  The Destiny Islands are a beautiful paradise where children�s laughter
abounds. Day after day, Sora, Riku, and Kairi talk and dream of new places, new
worlds beyond their islands. They ponder the usual questions that adolescents
do -- about the world outside, about their own existence. Little do they know a
great destiny awaits them. One stormy night, a terrible darkness invades the
Destiny Islands. Thus does their journey begin...

  Sora awakens in another world, in a place called Traverse Town. His hopes of
seeing new worlds are realized, but his friends Riku and Kairi are nowhere in
sight.

  Meanwhile, Donald and Goofy have also arrived in Traverse Town. They have come
from Disney Castle in search of a �key� and its owner. Their king, who has
mysteriously disappeared, has left them a cryptic message: "Now, there�s
somebody with a �key� -- the key to our survival... We need that key."

  What is happening to this world? The "somebody" mentioned by the missing king
turns out to be Sora. To find Kairi and Riku, Sora joins Donald and Goofy and
embarks on an epic journey.

Gauges
������
  There are three gauges in the bottom right corner for Sora and another two in
the top right corner of the screen for Sora's companions. The green one is the
Hit Points (HP) Gauge and reflects the amount of Health said character has left.
Once it falls below a certain point, a warning alarm will sound off, and the
gauge will flash red. The blue gauge shows your Magic Points (MP). MP decrease
when spells are cast. Some abilities consume MP as well. The orange bar is the
charge gauge. Once it fills up to a certain point, it is converted to MP. Spells
with low MP cost draw from the charge gauge first.

Experience Points and Rewards
�����������������������������
  You earn experience points by defeating enemies. Executing certain actions,
like parrying an attack, also yield experience points in the form of Tech Points
and the amount earned differs based on equipment and abilities you have. There
are several items that enemies leave behind when they are defeated. The Green
Orbs restore HP and Clear Orbs refill the charge gauge. Yellow Orbs are Munny,
the currency of the game, and Treasure Chests that drop contain items. In all
instances, the larger the orb the greater the effect or value.

on the difficulty, Final Mix Proud. If you are playing on a different level of
difficulty then these tactics still apply, the fights just might be a little
easier for you.

Choose One, Sacrifice Another
�����������������������������
  Sora starts out in a "Dive to the Heart," a place inside of himself that acts
like a dream. You gain control at the Snow White Platform where you must choose
one item and sacrifice another. These choices serve as a starting point for your
stats and also determine your skill order while leveling.

                                   Dream Rod
                                   ���������
                           The power of the mystic.
                                Inner strength.
                          A staff of wonder and ruin.

                                 Dream Shield
                                 ������������
                          The power of the guardian.
                           Kindness to aid friends.
                            A shield to repel all.

                                  Dream Sword
                                  �����������
                           The power of the warrior.
                              Invincible courage.
                        A sword of terrible destruction.

  The choice you really need to make is going to be whether you want +2 Item
Slots or want 3 MP instead of 2. Taking the Dream Rod will always net 3 MP at
the start of the game and 10 MP at the end. Taking the Sword or Shield will have
you start with 2 MP and finish the game with 8 MP. The Shield always gives the
+2 Item Slots so choosing Sword has no statistical benefit since you can
increase your Strength, Defense, and AP through items to reach their maximum.

The Power to Fight
������������������
  After choosing your path you will fall to the Cinderella Platform where a
Shadow will appear.

|���|��������������������������������������������������������������������������|
| S | HP: 10       Experience: 1       Drop: HP balls                          |
| H |                                                                          |
| A |  Shadows are the most common enemy that Sora will encounter. They are    |
| D | the most basic Heartless and aren't very strong. Shadows are rarely      |
| O | alone and thus attack in groups. When they sink into the ground they are |
| W | unable to be damaged but you can still lock onto them.                   |
|___|__________________________________________________________________________|

  Defeat the Shadow and you are forced to fight a few more. With the foes
defeated you are taken to another platform. Examine the door then open the
# DONE: [CHEST] # that appears then push the box around and smash it to receive your first
item in the game, a # DONE: [POTION] #. Break the barrel that appears and you can open the
door to reach a new area.

  When you arrive on the ship at Destiny Islands there will be three members
of the Final Fantasy crew to greet you. They will each ask a question that
affects the pace at which you will level throughout the course of the game.
Choosing the first set of answers will start you at Dawn, choosing the middle
set starts you at Midday, and the third set of answers starts you in the Dead
of Night. There are 25 possible combinations based on your choices but you can
always back out if you don't get the desired result.

  As you can see, choosing Dusk requires   |  90 | 698,291 | 769,815 | 804,856 |
more experience to level than Midday and   |  95 | 788,291 | 859,815 | 894,856 |
Dawn until about level 40. Afterwards, it  | 100 | 878,291 | 949,815 | 984,856 |
takes less experience to level.            |_____|_________|_________|_________|

Defeat the Darkness
�������������������
  You return on the Aurora Platform. You'll have to fight more Shadows but you
are given an opportunity to save. A pathway appears that leads to the Belle
Platform where a large heartless appear before Sora.

| Tech Points so you can gain some extra experience while fighting him. After |
| some time Darkside will use Darkness Orb, an attack that launches orbs of   |
| darkness that seek to your location. You can parry them backwards for Tech  |
| Points and some damage, but it's best to outrun them. You can lose this     |

Supplies for the Raft
���������������������
  Talk to Kairi once you gain control to get your list of things to collect --
two Logs, one Cloth, one Rope. Run along the beach and you'll spot one of the
# DONE: [LOGS] # you need. Continue up the short steps near the waterfall and climb the
ladder. Follow this path to the ship (which you may recall from earlier) to
find the # DONE: [ROPE] # in the corner. Head back down the ladder and follow the ramp
across from it up to a makeshift tree house where the # DONE: [CLOTH] # can be found.

  The final item is found on the small island. To reach it enter the Seaside
Shack, where you'll find a Save Point, and exit atop. Likewise, you can jump
from near the waterfall to get up top and cross the bridge or swim behind the
island and use the ladder. Return to Kairi with the items in hand to receive a
# DONE: [HI-POTION] # for your efforts. You can call it a day or explore this half of the
island more if you wish.

Dueling
�������
  If you talk to Wakka, Selphie, Tidus, or Riku they will offer up a duel. This
is a good opportunity to get a little experience, gain Potions, or raise your
score versus Riku.

| K |  He will throw his Blitzball at you and you can knock it back at him.    |
| K | Doing so results in 1 Tech Point and it leaves Wakka stunned. Use this   |
| A | opportunity to get in a combo. Wakka also does a jumping throw signaled  |
|   | by his shout, "Take this!" which can be knocked back for 2 Tech Points   |
|   | and a resulting stun.                                                    |

| L |  She swings her jump rope around at you and you can deflect it back at   |
| P | her for 1 Tech Point and a stun. Like Wakka, the stun leaves her open    |
| H | for a chain attack. Selphie doesn't defend much so an all-out attack is  |
| I | a good option as well, especially since Selphie has fewer Hit Points     |
| E | then the rest of the gang.                                               |

| D |  He uses a jumping attack and often follows with a side step. Timing the |
| U | parry on his normal attack will net 2 Tech Points but you can also swing |
| S | just before he leaps to start a combo. Using Aerial attacks is a good    |
|   | idea against Tidus since it often leaves you behind him, especially      |
|   | after he uses a leaping strike.                                          |

| A |  After defeating all three Final Fantasy characters you'll receive the   |
| M | option to duel them in a 3 vs 1 by talking to Tidus. The best way to win |
|   | this fight is to take out Selphie first since she has the lowest HP. It  |
| D | lets you focus on dodging Wakka's Blitzball while you smack her around.  |
| U | Take out Tidus next by countering his leaping strike, but watch for the  |
| E | chance to knock Blitzballs back at Wakka. Obviously, Wakka goes last and |

| K |  Riku's tactic is to leap behind Sora and crack him in the back of the   |
| U | head. This should also be your tactic since Riku will parry your attacks |
|   | from the front with ease. If you unleash a full combo on Riku he'll land |
|   | on his back and spring forward with a vicious strike, just be sure to    |
|   | dodge it and you can counter.                                            |

Food for the Journey
��������������������
  The second half of the island opens up now. Head through the door that Kairi
was blocking to enter the Cove and start a race with Riku. The best way to win
the race is to simply run (don't jump) off the edge instead of following Riku.
Run through the water and up the steps then run off the edge again. Run right
of the boat and up the ramp, then jump up to the Star. Run off the edge and
go back the same way you came. Riku takes his time jumping around which slows
him down (and you too if you jump!) so just running is fastest. You receive a
# DONE: [PRETTY STONE] # # for winning the race.

  With the race over, jump across the docks to the other side. To the right is
a box that you can pick up and throw. To the left of the docks is an alcove high
above. Position the box close enough so that you can jump up and claim the
# DONE: [PROTECT CHAIN] from the [CHEST]. Jump down and grab the DONE: [MUSHROOM] # between the
bushes. Jump down to the beach and push the rock out of the way to reach another
alcove with a # DONE: [MUSHROOM] #. Talk to Kairi to get a list of items -- one Seagull
Egg, three Mushrooms, two Coconuts, three Fish, and some Drinking Water.

  Smack the trees nearby until you collect two # DONE: [COCONUTS] #. Return to the
Seashore and jump into the ocean to collect three # DONE: [FISH] # then talk to Wakka.
Run under the waterfall to obtain some # DONE: [DRINKING WATER] # then head into the
Secret Place. In the cave you'll find the final # DONE: [MUSHROOM] # and a scene occurs.
Climb atop the Seaside Shack and up the skinny tree. Jump from here atop the
other tree to grab the # DONE: [SEAGULL EGG] #. Return to Kairi to obtain another # DONE [HI-
POTION] and call it a day when you're ready.

The Door Has Opened...
����������������������
  After some cutscenes you'll gain control of Sora on Destiny Islands at night.
The island is under attack by Shadows, but your wooden sword won't affect them!
Head to the island where Riku is located for another scene. Sora obtains the
# DONE: [KINGDOM KEY] # Keyblade at this point and can now damage the Heartless. You may
defeat the Shadows as long as you would like but the objective is the Secret
Place. Inside you'll find Kairi, but another scene takes over and you once again
find yourself fighting Darkside.

| HP: 300                    |  This time around Darkside is a little bit     |
| Attack: 6                  | stronger. It stills uses the Summon Shadow     |

| Experience: 60             | into the ground and pull out a huge ball of    |
|----------------------------' darkness before using the attack. You'll be    |
| able to deal a significant amount of damage during this time, just don't    |
| get hit by the ball of darkness. Unlike the previous battle, you must win   |
| this one so don't hold back if you need to use a Potion.                    |

The First District
������������������
  Sora arrives in Traverse Town and is awakened by Pluto. This world is the main
hub for people from all different worlds that were attacked by the Heartless.
You will spend a lot of time in Traverse Town because of the Accessory Shop, the
large building in the center of this First District. Go south of the afore-
mentioned shop to find the Item Shop located next to the steps. Sell your Pretty
Stone then target the fan on the ceiling and hit it to receive a # DONE: [POSTCARD] #.

  Leave the Item Shop and take the Postcard to the funny looking Mailbox.
Deliver it to receive a # DONE: [COTTAGE] #. Head up the steps past the Accessory Shop and
look right to find some crates. Push the large one over to the shop and use it
to reach the roof. Open the # DONE: [CHEST] to find another [POSTCARD] #, which can be
mailed for a # DONE: [MYTHRIL SHARD] #. Enter the Accessory Shop and talk to Cid to gain
some understanding of where you are. Jump atop the shelf to Cid's left to find
a # DONE: [CHEST] containing a [MYTHRIL SHARD] #. Note that there is also a Save Point in
the shop.

The Second District
�������������������
  As you enter the Second District you'll witness a man losing his Heart. Some
Shadows appear and you'll need to defeat them before progressing. To the right
is a # DONE: [CHEST] # on an awning. You'll need to jump from the nearby lantern to reach
it and obtain the # [POSTCARD] which can be mailed for a DONE [MEGA-POTION] #. Head
along this side of the district towards the large building at the opposite end.
Jump across the gap and then over to the Gizmo Shop ledge. From here you can
reach the # DONE: [CHEST] with a [MEGA-POTION] # inside.

  You can enter the Gizmo Shop and fight waves of Shadows for some decent
experience and Munny. You want to enter the Dalmatians' House afterwards to
learn about Pongo and Perdita's 99 missing Dalmatians. Exit through the house
to the Alleyway and head to the far side to find a # DONE: [POTION] within a [CHEST] #.
If you climb into the balconies you can find another # DONE: [CHEST] # with another
# DONE: [POTION] # at the end near the Dalmatians' House. On the opposite end you'll need
to look over the balcony towards the chest on the ground to notice another
# DONE: [CHEST] on a ledge -- it contains a [PRETTY STONE] #.

  Head back to the Second District and enter the Hotel to trigger another scene
with Donald and Goofy searching for something. Venture to the Third District via
the alley that splits the Second District then return to Cid in the Accessory
Shop. Save your game and leave the Shop to finally find someone.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HP: 120                    |  First off, this battle can be pretty tough    |
| Attack: 8                  | being at a low level. Second, you are really   |
| Defense: 8                 | not supposed to win the battle and the scene   |
| Weak: N/A                  | afterwards is the same regardless of whether   |
| Resist: N/A                | you "win" or not. Leon hits pretty hard with   |
| Drop: Elixir               | a quick one-two cut, but it can be parried for |
| Experience: 30             | 1 Tech Point and leaves Leon open for a combo. |
|----------------------------' Leon also casts Fire, which should be dodged   |
| unless you are skillful enough to reflect is back at Leon. Performing this  |
| skillful maneuver stuns Leon for quite some time and allows you to get in   |
| some good damage. Waiting around for this moment requires a lot of patience |
| but is the safest way to defeat Leon. Likewise, you can employ a hit and    |
| run tactic where you only swing twice then run to dodge Leon's attacks but  |
| it can be risky. The best way to win is wait for Leon to jump towards you,  |
| then quickly move so you are behind him and unleash a 3-hit combo.          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 �����������������������������������������������������������������������������

Take out the Leader
�������������������
  After the scenes talk to Yuffie then open the # CHEST # on the table for the
# DONE: [ELIXIR] #. Check the pictures around the room then jump up and hit the clock
above Leon's head until it reads 7:00. A sound will indicate a # CHEST # spawning
behind you on the seat, it contains a # DONE: [MYTHRIL] #. Let Leon know when you're ready
and head out.

| I |  Soldiers claw like Shadows but deal more damage and have more HP. They |
| E | can dash towards you to try for a high damage attack, but if you time   |
| R | it right you can hit their head for some Tech Points. Long combos work  |
|   | best against the Soldier as well as Aerial combos.                      |
|___|_________________________________________________________________________|

  Head out to the Second District and get some practice against the Soldiers
then go to the First District. Talk to Aerith outside the Accessory Shop to
receive a # DONE: [MEGA-POTION] #. Before heading out, it's not a bad idea to pick up a
Fire Ring or Protect Chain to raise your defense just a bit for the boss that
awaits you. Head to the Third District when you're set. You meet up with Donald
and Goofy to fight off a large group of Soldiers. Once you defeat them the
leader that Leon mentioned emerges.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HP: 84 (Arm), 196 (Leg), 120 (Body)|  The Guard Armor has multiple parts    |
| Attack: 11 (Arm/Leg), 8 (Body)     | that can all deal damage. You'll want  |
| Defense: 10 (Arm/Leg, 8 (Body)     | to target the arms first since they    |
| Weak: N/A                          | have the fewest HP, though they have   |
| Resist: N/A                        | the least dangerous attack. They spin  |
| Drop: Brave Warrior                | around from time to time and can knock |
| Experience: 110 (Body)             | you way back. While spinning, if you   |
|------------------------------------' get a shot in on them you'll stun the  |
| arms and they'll fall lifeless for a few seconds so you can get additional  |
| damage! Next, take out the legs which can also detach and start stomping    |
| around dealing a little damage but mainly knocking you back. Attack them    |
| from behind while detached and they'll go lifeless for a few seconds. While |
| all of this is happening, you need to watch out for a Body Slam from the    |
| Body. This attack can deal a lot of damage and possibly kill you in a       |
| single hit if you are a little under leveled. Once the arms and legs have   |
| been defeated the Body isn't much of a threat.                              |

Traverse Town Aftermath
�����������������������
  After the scene Aerith will give you # DONE: [500 MUNNY] #. If you beat Leon earlier
you'll also receive an # done: [ELIXIR] #. Head towards the dining area next to the Item
Shop to spot # DONE: [TRINITY JUMP #1]. Use it to reach a [CHEST] with a [POSTCARD] #
inside -- it can be mailed for a # DONE: [MEGA-ETHER] #. Head towards the exit gates and
look left for # DONE: [TRINITY JUMP #2] # that results in a lot of Munny. From here go
towards the Second District and jump over the short wall to the safe. You can
unlock the safe now to receive a # DONE: [POSTCARD] that can be mailed for a [MYTHRIL] #.
Now go through the Second District to the Hotel then to the Red Room to find a
# CHEST with a DONE [PRETTY STONE] #. Now, head through the Gizmo Shop in the Second
District and use the ladder.

  This takes you up to the upper level roofs. Cross the narrow path and jump
to the large building across the gap. Move towards the hole straight ahead and
look left for a # CHEST containing a [MYTHRIL SHARD] #. Go through the hole to
reach a balcony in the Third District. Check the corners here with R1 to lock
onto and examine a # DONE: [POSTCARD] that can be mailed for an [ELIXIR] #. Jump down and
go behind the "Lady and the Tramp" statues to find # DONE: [TRINITY JUMP #3] # which gives
a [CAMPING SET] # and lots of Munny.

  Lastly, head to the door with a flame on it and cast Fire to reach the
Mystical House. Jump across the stones and enter the Empty House via the hole
in the left side. Here you'll meet Merlin and the Fairy Godmother, but you're
really here for the # DONE: [TRINITY JUMP #4] # which nets a lot of Munny and a [MEGA-
ETHER]. From here you are left to equipping the party and stocking up on some
Potions before leaving to the Gummi Ship; picking up Donald's # DONE: [MORNING STAR] #
and Goofy's # DONE: [SMASHER] # aren't a bad idea. You'll also want to purchase at least 5
Potions before leaving. They won't be used for healing, but for gaining access
to new areas in the next world.

Gummi Ship Adventures!
����������������������
  When you leave Traverse Town you'll have the option of going to one of the two
available worlds. Choose the top one (Battle LV 1) to get started. This first
course doesn't offer much in terms of difficulty. You'll have to break through
some rocks that block your path, but otherwise it's a safe trip. Nothing even
shoots back at you. Disembark when you arrive to reach Wonderland.

this room you're clearly too large, so approach the Doorknob to get things
started. Push the bed in then drink the contents of the bottle. When you drop
down you'll find a new enemy.

| T | deflecting their attack results in a stun so you can kill them pretty   |
| U | quickly. In a group you can get surrounded and pummeled easily so take  |
| R | them out quickly. Once you acquire Blizzard you'll get Tech Points for  |
| N | using that spell on them, to which they are also weak and take          |
| E | additional damage.                                                      |
|___|_________________________________________________________________________|

  After you clear out the Heartless head through the hole you revealed when you
pushed the bed in. When the scene ends you're tasked with finding evidence of
Alice's innocence.

Evidence for the Red Queen
��������������������������
  Head out to the Lotus Forest to meet the Cheshire Cat. He mentions four pieces
of evidence, but you need only one to start the trial. It is, however,
incredibly useful to find all of the pieces so let's get started. Clear out the
Heartless and turn into the alcove past the red flower to find # DONE: [TRINITY JUMP #5] #
to receive an [ETHER], [POTION], and [TENT] #. In this alcove you'll also find
the # DONE: [FOOTPRINTS] #, your first piece of evidence. Give the flower here a Potion
to receive a # DONE: [HI-POTION] #. The red flower you passed earlier wants an Ether and
will produce a # DONE: [CAMPING SET] # for your patronage. The other red flower along the
path will do the same.

  Head to the far side of the Lotus Forest and climb the rock to reach a lily
pad with an # DONE: [ANTENNA]. From this pad you can spot a [CHEST] # high above in the
corner. It is possible to make this jump and have Sora grab the ledge, you just
need to jump at the absolute end of the pad while running to grab it; the chest
holds a # DONE: [SCAN-G] #. Head back to the alcove and climb the mushrooms up to a hole
in the tree. Go through it to arrive back in the Bizarre Room right next to the
# DONE: [STENCH] #.

Bonus Evidence
��������������
  The last piece of evidence is the tricky one that the Cheshire Cat alluded to.
First head back to the Lotus Forest where the large rock is located. Jump on
the mushrooms and go left to reach a platform where you can jump across to the
acorn. Hop down to the # CHEST to find DONE [DALMATIANS 16, 17, & 18] # then return to
the entrance. Give the yellow flower a Potion and Sora becomes huge. Step on the
stump near the entrance then "Take" the acorn from the tree. Hit the tree to
change its direction then eat the acorn. Climb the tree once more and use the
newly raised platform to reach a hole in the corner. From here you land on a
faucet in the Bizarre Room. Carefully jump across to the # DONE: [CLAW MARKS] # to receive
the # DONE: [BLIZZARD] # magic.

The Red Queen's Trial
���������������������
  Save your game back in the Queen's Castle then approach the Ace of Hearts to
present your evidence. There are five boxes of evidence and you can only choose
one so there will be a 20% chance you pick the wrong one. If you choose the
wrong one then Donald, Goofy, or both will be locked up during the next battle
but you can break them out so it's not a big deal.

|     24 (Tower), 9 (Crank), 10 (Queen)| bring down Alice's cage so she can   |
| Attack: 9 (Heart/Spade/Queen)        | be freed. You need to break the 3    |
| Defense: 9 (Heart/Spade/Queen)       | cranks around the tower and they     |
| Weak: N/A                            | only take 1 HP worth of damage every |
| Resist: N/A                          | hit. While this is happening the     |
| Drop: N/A                            | Cards will be attacking you and they |
| Experience: 100 (Tower/Queen)        | can hurt. It's usually best to take  |
|--------------------------------------' out a few Cards first then get to    |
| work on breaking the tower. You can knock the Queen out in a single hit     |
| most of the time. The Cards get back up over time so you can't just dispose |
| of them and then break the tower after. The tower can be targeted after the |
| cranks have been broken and also only takes 1 HP worth of damage every hit. |
| It's not a bad idea to use Fire repeatedly to hit the crank and tower since |
| it shoots fast and can end the fight quickly.                               |

Where'd Alice Go?
�����������������
  Head back into the Bizarre Room and drink the contents of the bottle to return
to the Rabbit Hole. At the beginning you'll find some enemies that can be
defeated to reveal a # CHEST. Inside you'll find a DONE [MEGA-POTION] # as a nice
reward. You'll also probably notice that there are some new enemies you might
encounter.

| G |  This Heartless is new to Final Mix and can only be found in one        |
| A | location in the entire game, the Bizarre Room in Wonderland. When you   |
| S | enter there will either be all Shadows or a mix of Soldiers, Large      |
|   | Bodies, and Red Nocturne. You want to enter the Bizarre Room when there |
| S | is just Shadows. Defeat three waves of them and the Gigas Shadows will  |
| H | appear. There isn't anything special about them other than being huge   |
| A | versions of the Shadow. The trick is to not get hit because once you do |
| D | that Gigas Shadow will disappear and there's only 7 of them. The drop   |
| O | rate is based on how many you defeat: 3 (10%), 4 (20%), 5 (35%), 6      |
| W | (50%), and 7 (100%, 2 items).                                           |

|   |  If you equip items to reach maximum MP and have Cheer on everyone then |
|   | you can summon Dumbo and use Splash to kill all the Gigas Shadows       |
|   | without fear of taking damage since you're invincible. This is the best |
|   | method for easily acquiring Fury Stones.                                |

| E |  The Large Body is one of the more annoying Heartless you'll fight. It  |
|   | is best to strike at its back since you'll get reflected at the belly.  |
| B | If the Large Body taps it's belly it will charge at you so either Dodge |
| O | Roll at an angle towards but away from it or hit it with magic to force |
| D | the Large Body to stop. Likewise, you can counter by timing your strike |
| Y | with the Keyblade to stun the Large Body when it charges. This leaves   |
|   | the Large Body exposed for combos to its back. Goofy can be useful for  |
|   | his spinning shield attack deals a lot of damage to the Large Body. In  |
|   | the same sense, Donald is useful for countering charges with magic. The |
|   | most important thing is to leave the Large Body for last when in battle |
|   | because trying to kill it while you are being shot at raises the        |
|   | difficulty of this foe.                                                 |

Curiouser and Curiouser
�����������������������
  Head back to the Lotus Forest and clear out the Heartless then give the yellow
flower a Potion again to grow larger. Push the rock into the water to raise two
platforms then "Take" the acorn by hitting the tree. Hit the tree again to move
it back away from you, then eat the acorn. Use the new platforms to reach an
area with # DONE: [TRINITY JUMP #6] -- it yields a [CAMPING SET] # and plenty of MP. You
can also give the red flower a Hi-Potion to receive a # DONE: [MEGA-POTION] # in return.
By that math, you can turn Potions into Mega-Potions by resetting the flowers
and buying Potions, feeding them to the red flower near the entrance, then using
the Hi-Potion they give on the red flower you just fed. Curious.

  Go through the doorway back to the Queen's Castle and open the # CHEST # to
receive find # DONE: [DALMATIANS 13, 14, & 15] #. Return to the Lotus Forest and head to
the back end. Climb up the tree using the mushrooms and enter the Bizarre Room
by jumping from the acorn branch across the gap. Clean out the Heartless the
"Touch" the lamp to light it and receive a # DONE: [DEFENSE UP] from the [CHEST] # that
spawns. Touch the second light to spawn a picture that you need to examine. In
this closed off area of the Lotus Forest you'll find two yellow flowers where
you can trade a Potion for a # DONE: [HI-POTION] and an Elixir for a [MYTHRIL SHARD] #.
With this area complete, return to the Bizarre Room.

        |   You will start to encounter White Mushrooms at this point |
        | in the game. They are pretty useful for obtaining rarer     |
        | items for synthesis. It might seem insignificant at this    |
        | point but it'll save you some time later in the game if     |
        | you take advantage of the White Mushrooms starting now.     |
        | Don't go actively looking for them, just know what to do    |

  Hit the latch next to the Teddy Bear so that it drops into the chair. Now exit
the Bizarre Room and climb up the mushrooms near the entrance of the Lotus
Forest and reach the corner exit to return to the Bizarre Room. Turn the faucet
to animate the pot then jump into it to reach a # CHEST with a DONE [METEOR-G] #
inside. Drop down and enter the Bizarre Room from the Queen's Castle. Fight your
way back to the tabletop and grow big again. Read the #  [BOOK] # near the Teddy Bear
to receive a # DONE: [MYTHRIL SHARD] #. Now move the Teddy Bear to make the clock become
real, then move the clock and get small again.

  Enter the Tea Party Garden and open the # CHEST # before jumping down to receive
a # DONE: [DARK MATTER] #. There is a sign next to the Mad Hatter and March Hare picture
that details sitting down in the chairs around the table to receive a reward.
If you start a battle then the table goes away, so grab the rewards first!

| HP: 600                    |  Trickmaster can be a bit of a pain if you     |
| Attack: 9                  | don't understand his mechanics. While it may   |
| Defense: 9                 | seem a bit backwards, the best defense against |
| Weak: N/A                  | Trickmaster is to be constantly on offense. If |
| Resist: N/A                | you don't give the Trickmaster time to light   |
| Drop: Ifrit's Horn         | his batons then you'll be in good shape. You   |
| Experience: 150            | can tell when Trickmaster is attacking because |
|----------------------------' his legs stiffen up. Afterwards, he swoops     |
| down to attack so dodge and then counter this. If you stand in the corner   |
| near the Teddy Bear you can just leap from this chair to the Trickmaster    |
| deal damage to his body -- he doesn't take damage anywhere else while he is |
| standing. After a few combos, Trickmaster will collapse and you can really  |
| let him have it. Refrain from using Fire, it will just light the batons of  |
| Trickmaster and double his damage. Likewise, you can use Blizzard to put    |
| out the batons. If Trickmaster does go to the fireplace and lights his      |
| batons then you need to be ready to Dodge Roll as he will shoot Fire at you |
| and it does a lot of damage. Using the table in the center of the room is   |
| not a bad idea, it's just that the Trickmaster can smash it and you'll have |
| to wait for it to raise again. With all of this knowledge, the simplest way |
| to defeat Trickmaster is stand near the Teddy Bear and just let him have it |
| and he'll never light his batons and he'll collapse often so you'll finish  |
| the battle relatively quickly.                                              |

Becoming a Hero
���������������
  The Olympus Coliseum welcomes you with open arms and readily available items
to be had. In front of you are the gates, to left and right you'll find
TRINITY JUMP #7] and # TODO: [TRINITY JUMP #8] which yield [CHESTS] # containing a
# TODO: [MYTHRIL SHARD] and [DALMATIANS 22, 23, & 24]. There is also a [CHEST] # behind
the left side pillars that contains a # TODO: [MEGA-POTION] #. Enter the Lobby and talk to
Phil. Try to move the pedestal when he asks, but of course it won't budge. Talk
to Phil again and he will let you participate in the trials.

The Trials
����������
  The initial trial is to break 20 barrels within 30 seconds. It's not that
difficult, just start comboing all the way through the barrels straight ahead
then take out the remaining two at the end. The next trial is to break 25
barrels within a minute. Start by running around the perimeter and destroying
these barrels. Once you reach the start jump up and smash the next three then
continue climbing and smashing. At the top you'll have to combo one barrel into
another to save time, otherwise just use Fire to target the barrel that's far
away across the gap.

  Phil seems to stiff the group, but at least he hands over the power of
# TODO: [THUNDER]. Leave the Lobby and meet Hades who hands over an [ENTRY PASS] #. Turn
back around and talk to Phil in the Lobby to start the Preliminaries, just make
sure you save first. During the Preliminaries you'll face a new Heartless, the
Blue Rhapsody.

|   |  The Blue Rhapsody functions much like it's counterpart, the Red        |
| R | Nocturne. It will whiz around and cast Blizzard spells, so in a group   |
| H | you can be completely surrounded and take some damage. Fortunately,     |
| A | these little fellows are low on HP and are weak against Fire. Casting   |
| P | Fire on the Blue Rhapsody will result in Tech Points and generally kill |
| S | them in a single shot. In a group fight it's best to take out the Blue  |
| O | Rhapsody early so that you can focus on melee combat instead of dodging |
| D | spells. Lure them away from the melee attackers and cast Fire spells in |
| Y | quick succession to make short work of these Heartless.                 |
|___|_________________________________________________________________________|

The Preliminaries
�����������������
  The key to making it through is utilizing your spells when you need to and
focusing on the melee attackers. Blast Red Nocturnes with Blizzard to quickly
eliminate a foe that would drain a lot of your HP. The same applies to the Blue
Rhapsody, focus them down with Fire and then tackle the Soldiers or Shadows that
accompany them. In battles where both of the wizards exist, use Blizzard first
to wipe out all the Red Nocturnes. Once you clear the first six rounds you'll be
faced against Cloud.

| Drop: Inferno Band         | slow so you can Dodge Roll to avoid and even   |
| Experience: 200            | get up in Cerberus' face and attack during     |
|----------------------------' this time. Next, Cerberus will likely start    |
| using it's three heads to attack in a snapping action. Stand off to the     |
| side and attack one of the outer heads immediately after it snaps, you      |
| should be able to get two hits in every time and this phase lasts awhile.   |
| Cerberus will also rear up and slam the ground, just jump over the shock    |
| wave. Lastly, Cerberus spews Darkness from its mouth and voids begin to     |
| appear beneath Sora's location. You can just run and Dodge Roll around to   |
| avoid the damage here. If at any time you have a bunch of MP just get some  |
| space and let Fire fly. Overall, Cerberus is one of the easier bosses.      |

  After the battle the group will receive the # TODO: [HERO LICENSE] #. Head outside and
talk to Cloud to learn # TODO: [SONIC BLADE] #. As you leave there is another scene. You
have the option of going on to the Battle LV 3 world now if you want but there
is some stuff in Traverse Town if you want to go back.

Lighting Up Traverse Town
�������������������������
  With Thunder available to Sora, head to the Third District. There is a broken
wire in one of the corners, use Thunder on it. This will power the Gizmo Shop,
so head over to it via the Second District. Clear out the enemies and climb up
to the second level. Step on the three raised platforms on the second level and
you'll hear a chime. Hop back down and check the clock to receive not one, but
two # TODO: [POSTCARDS]. You can turn them both in for a [MEGALIXIR] and [ORICHALCUM] #.
While you're here you can also visit the Dalmatians' House to receive a
# TODO: [CURAGA-G] # for finding so many of their puppies. When you're all finished, head
to the Battle LV 3 world, Deep Jungle.

...And Wonderland?
������������������
  With Thunder you can visit Wonderland's Lotus Forest to unveil a new chest.
Jump up the platforms in the fake pond to the left of the entrance. Use Thunder
on the bells to spawn a # CHEST with [THUNDARA-G] # inside. If you enter the
Bizarre Room from the Lotus Forest's far end atop the canopy then examine the
picture you'll be taken another area where you can use Thunder on the bells. The
# CHEST that spawns has [DALMATIANS 58, 59, & 60] # inside.

Sabor, Danger
�������������
  As you gain control of Sora you're immediately in a fight against Sabor. This
cat has minimal attacks but it's slashes can hurt. He's pretty easy to beat
though, so just let him have it. When you regain control, head outside and grab
the barrel. Bring it back in and position it close enough to the steps that you
can run up them. At the second level exit and turn left, jumping the small gap.
It seems like a dead end here, but you can actually jump around the corner to
a platform with a ladder. Climb the ladder and jump the gap on the roof to find
a # CHEST with a [PROTECT CHAIN] #.

  Drop down to the netting below the treehouse and you can spot another # CHEST #
on a second tier, it holds a # TODO: [MEGA-POTION] #. Jump down into the canopy of trees
to land in a new area. There is a Save Point and a # CHEST # containing a [MEGA-
ETHER] on a second level platform. When you are ready, jump into the hollow
log and go along for the ride. Taking this shortcut throws you right into camp.
Enter the tent to find Jane and be reunited with Donald and Goofy. Put them both
in your party so you can utilize the Trinities.

Camp Exploration
����������������
  You receive the # TODO: [PROTECT-G] # that Donald and Goofy found after the scene.
Start by opening the # CHEST for a [MYTHRIL SHARD] # then exit the tent. Go to the
left side past the table to find # TODO: [TRINITY JUMP #9] -- it spawns a [CHEST] # with
# TODO: [DALMATIANS 34, 35, & 36] #. Check the grandfather clock near Clayton for [RECIPE
CARD 1] then check the flagpole just outside the tent for # TODO: [RECIPE CARD 2] #. Head
to the stove pot and "Examine" it to place a Potion inside. Target the stove and
cast Fire to receive a # TODO: [HI-POTION] #.

  Head back to the clothesline and check the pink shirt for # TODO: [RESEARCH NOTE 1] #
then search the globe near the tent for # TODO: [RESEARCH NOTE 2] #. There is also a third
note, examine the record player for # TODO: [RESEARCH NOTE 3] #. Head to the lab table and
"Examine" the flasks to place a Potion inside. Cast Blizzard and you'll receive
# TODO: [ETHER x2] #. Now you need to collect all six slides around the camp:

      Slide 1 - Atop the camp tent. Reach it by climbing the briefcases.
      Slide 2 - Atop a dresser to the right of the tent.
      Slide 3 - To the left of the tent near an easel.
      Slide 4 - Atop the pile of crates in front of the tent.
      Slide 5 - Climb atop the camp tent and run along the white canopy.
      Slide 6 - On the briefcases to the left of the tent.

|   | of them is the right one. They line up, so stand far enough back to see |
| B | all of them. One of the Black Ballades will bob up and down then the    |
| A | group will rotate positions pretty quickly. Follow the one that moved   |
| L | and hit it after they stop. You'll get Tech Points, some Munny, and HP  |
| L | balls for getting the right one, but choosing the wrong one and you get |
| A | zapped. Mess up three times and you're out, the Black Ballades leave.   |
| D | Items have a 10% chance of dropping when you hit the right Black        |
| E | Ballade and a 100% chance if you hit the right one four straight times. |

Kerchak, Friend
���������������
  Return to Jane and place the slides in the projector. After a scene you can
leave the tent, only to be ambushed by Sabor again! Head down the left side to
enter Hippo's Lagoon. Jump across all the Hippos to reach a # CHEST # with
# TODO: [DALMATIANS 25, 26, & 27] #.  Now swim over to the platform at your right and
climb up the right set of trees to reach a # CHEST with a [MEGA-POTION] #. On the
opposite side of the river you can spot another chest. You'll need to jump from
the other side and swing the Keyblade at the perfect time to make it, but it is
possible. If you can't make the jump you can always come back later when you
learn a new skill. The # CHEST has a [METEOR-G] # inside.

  Head back towards the entrance and climb the vine to reach Vines (not to be
confused with the Vines 2, which is coming up). Swing across the vines to
another platform, then swing from here to a # CHEST -- a [MYTHRIL] #. Continue to
swing from vine to vine until you reach Vines 2. After the scene swing across
to the next platform and open the # CHEST to find [DALMATIANS 28, 29, & 30] #.
Now swing back to the platform you started at and climb the vine to reach the
Climbing Trees.

Attack of the Wild
������������������
  Follow the path around to # TODO: [TRINITY JUMP #10] which reveals a [CHEST] # with a
# TODO: [THUNDARA-G] #. Enter the Tree House area from here to start another scene. Jump
off the edge near the bottom of the area, where you can see a plank extended out
and rope hanging down below. You'll land in the Cliffs where Sabor will ambush
you once again. Defeat him and climb to the upper tier to find two # TODO: [CHESTS] # -- a
# TODO: [MEGA-POTION] and [MYTHRIL SHARD] #. Return to the Camp Tent for a scene.

Save the Gorillas
�����������������
  The objective now is to stop Clayton from getting the gorillas. Start out at
the Camp and defeat the Powerwilds. You'll go to a few other areas that you've
already been to and receive a reward each time you save a gorilla.

      Camp - Protect-G
      Bamboo Thicket - Fire-G
      Cliff - Aeroga-G
      Climbing Trees - Aeroga-G
      Tree House - Shell-G

        |�������������������������������������������������������������|
        |  When returning to the Tree House there is a chance you'll  |
        | find White Mushrooms that are Stopped. You can't do help    |
        | them right now, but when you get Stop you can return.       |

| N |  The Pink Agaricus appears in two locations, one of which is the Tree   |
| K | House in Deep Jungle. When you enter the Tree House you'll find three   |
|   | White Mushrooms that are Stopped. Cast Stop on them and they'll animate |
| A | then drop clear orbs. After you animate all three, check inside the     |
| G | Tree House for the Pink Agaricus. The objective is to cast Stop on the  |
| A | Heartless then hit it as many times as you can before it can move again |
| R | to increase the drop rate. Having Aeroga on Sora and using Ragnarok is  |
| I | the best way to get a high number, though having to hit Triangle will   |
| C | also force Donald and Goofy to hit the Pink Agaricus and actually lower |
| U | your hit count (Note: In the original Final Mix it is possible to get   |
| S | 100 hits but it is not possible in this version because of this new     |
|   | "feature"). At 40, 50, and 60 hits there is a 10% drop chance. At 70,   |
|   | 80, and 90 its 20%. There is a 100% drop chance at 100 hits but again,  |
|   | it is not possible.                                                     |

  Return to Jane after saving the gorillas then head out to the Bamboo Thicket
to find Sabor waiting for you.

| HP: 180                    |  Sabor isn't messing around anymore. He is     |
| Attack: 12                 | faster, stronger, and has more HP. In this     |
| Defense: 11                | area he also has the benefit of jumping in and |
| Weak: N/A                  | out of the thicket. Using Fire and Sonic Blade |
| Resist: N/A                | work out really well this time around. You may |
| Drop: White Fang           | find using Guard and then countering to work   |
| Experience: 150            | out as well. Either way, Sabor still isn't a   |
|----------------------------' large threat and should go down after a few    |
| combos. If for some reason you are having trouble, remember to Dodge Roll   |
| away from his attacks and the Dodge Roll back into him to close the gap.    |
| Follow this up with a combo and watch the combo finisher knock Sabor across |
| the battlefield. Blasting Sabor with Fire is always a good idea too.        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 �����������������������������������������������������������������������������
Save Jane Too!
��������������
  After you defeat Sabor you'll view a scene with Jane. Head back to the tent
then back to the Climbing Trees. You objective is to find the four black
unbloomed flowers and cast magic on them so that they open. One is right at the
beginning, another is on the tree in the center. The third is up above the Tree
House entrance and the last one is where Jane and Terk are, you'll need to use
Fire after locking on. Once they are all opened attack the large fruit hanging
from the tree to free your friends.

  Return to the Camp and save your game. You'll want to swap out Donald for the
next battle because he's going to useless. Take off Healing Herb and Wind Armor
from Tarzan's abilities and instead equip the two Critical Plus abilities he
has. The amount of physical damage that Tarzan deals will really help in the
coming fight. Give Goofy a bunch of Potions then head to the Cliff to find
Clayton.

| Resist: N/A                            | appears riding the invisible boss, |
| Drop: Mega-Potion (Stealth Sneak)      | the Stealth Sneak. You'll want to  |
| Experience: 270                        | go all out against Stealth Sneak   |
|----------------------------------------' so that it becomes visible and     |
| easier to hit. You're going to take damage so be ready to toss yourself a   |
| Potion if Goofy doesn't do it for you. The battle ends when Clayton is      |
| defeated but it's hard to take him out when the Stealth Sneak is pummeling  |
| you so take out the lizard first. Using Sonic Blade should deal quite a bit |
| of damage and could stun the Stealth Sneak which is useful for additional   |
| combos. Listen for Clayton to yell, "Gotcha!" so you can dodge his shots    |
| and keep attacking Stealth Sneak. Eventually the lizard becomes immune to   |
| damage so switch to Clayton and be on the look out for the lizard's vicious |
| Eye Beam attack. The beam itself travels pretty slowly but it is homing so  |
| you have to Dodge Roll to avoid, if you don't it's going to hurt. When the  |
| Stealth Sneak leaves its trance you can take it down to 1 HP before it goes |
| back into it. Focus Clayton down and he'll start burning through Potions to |
| keep alive. You'll be able to down the Stealth Sneak and then Clayton once  |
| the trance is over. Keep your health high and use your MP!                  |

Help with Gummis
����������������
  Start off by going down the alley past the Accessory Shop where Sora first
appeared in Traverse Town. Here you'll find # TODO: [TRINITY CHARGE #1] # and it leads to
a # CHEST in the Alleyway, [DALMATIANS 4, 5, & 6] #. Head to the Second District
and fight your way through the Gizmo Shop and down to the Dalmatians' House to
claim any rewards you might have for finding lost puppies.

| O |  The Yellow Opera functions just like the other wizards except that it  |
| W | casts balls of Thunder at you as opposed to Blizzard or Fire. The big   |
|   | downside here is that the Yellow Opera doesn't have a weakness like     |
| O | Fire or Blizzard that can instantly defeat them. Instead, you'll have   |
| P | to rely on smashing these Heartless into the ground. Since they lack a  |
| E | weakness it might be best to single them out and defeat them first as   |
| R | opposed to the other wizards you'll face. They are the strongest of the |
| A | three but aren't much trouble.                                          |

| N |  This wizard looks just like all the others you've faced but it is not  |
|   | an offensive wizard. Instead, this little guy whizzes around casting a  |
| R | light Cure on damaged compadres. Obviously, this is detrimental to      |
| E | defeating the Heartless so you'll want to target the Green Requiem's    |
| Q | first in every battle they are in. Often, the Green Requiem will join   |
| U | up with a Large Body and several other wizards. These fights can be     |
| I | harder than others since you have a lot of moving parts and a foe with  |
| E | a large HP reservoir, and that plays right into the hands of the Green  |
| M | Requiem.                                                                |

| S |  The Air Soldier fights much like a regular Soldier except it can fly   |
| O | around. This allows it to use a swooping charge instead of a straight   |
| L | on shot, thus it is harder to dodge, especially in a group. It's hard   |
| D | to catch the Air Soldier on the ground for a combo so you'll be forced  |
| I | to use magic or Aerial Combos to take them down. Air Soldiers are       |
| E | rarely by themselves and often accompany ground forces to give you a    |
| R | lot to think about -- take out other Heartless before these, however.   |

| I |  These pink Heartless appear in the middle of the Second District at    |
| P | Traverse Town. The objective is to not be seen or they will lock onto   |
| E | you and fire invisible projectiles that can't be dodged. At first, you  |
| R | will find just one Sniperwild, but as you defeat it more appear. The    |
| W | best tactic is going to be using Stop then trying to defeat as many as  |
| I | you can. Remember to have Donald and Goofy aid you when trying to take  |
| L | them out. You'll get 10 experience for killing one and an additional    |
| D | 10 for each one after that (10, then 20, then 30, etc..). After beating |
|   | 6 Sniperwilds there is a 35% chance to get the Power Drop. After 12 it  |
|   | is 50%, after 18 it's 60%, after 24 it's 100% drop, and if you get all  |
|   | 30 you'll get 2 more at 100% chance.                                    |

|   |  There is a pattern to the Sniperwild spawns. It starts with one, then  |
|   | once it's defeated two more spawn in the center. Once those two are     |
|   | defeated three will spawn in the center. Defeating these three resets   |
|   | the pattern. A riskier but more mana conserving way of defeating the    |
|   | Sniperwilds is to hit one with Fire while sitting near the entrance to  |
|   | the First District. It'll hop up to you and you can kill it from there. |
|   | If you are spotted and reinforcements are summoned you won't gain any   |
|   | items or experience for killing these Heartless, so just leave.         |

| Drop: N/A                     | reckless for the opening part of the battle |
| Experience: 390 (Body)        | since you'll likely parry attacks instead   |
|-------------------------------' of taking damage. Focus on the "feet" next  |
| but you likely won't defeat them before the Body pulls the feet in and      |
| charges up a powerful beam. This is best avoided by heading down one of the |
| alleys or using the steps to block the attack since it will fire regardless |
| of line of sight. Using Simba is a bad idea, instead just stick to aerial   |
| attacks and backing away to use Cure when your HP gets too low. The main    |
| Body will drop fast once it's by itself, just keep the pressure on.         |

reach another area, but at least the first new path is open. He will now sell
Gummi Blocks so buy what you need. The COM. 2 is great for expanding your

into the Alley where Jafar with dispatch Bandits to take you down, but you won't
have any of that. Once the Heartless have been defeated climb up to the next
level to find a # CHEST and another [MEGA-POTION] #. Use the Keyhole that's next
to the chest to unlock a door higher up. It can be reached by jumping across
the shutters but you don't need to go that way.

  Return to Main Street and head to the opposite end where you'll find a pole
you can climb to reach Aladdin's House. Check the # TODO: [CHESTS] # in here to find a

clear out the Heartless to help. You'll want to head back to Agrabah after

Reach the Palace

  Clear out the Plaza and climb up the crates so you can jump across to the
Alley. Defeat the Heartless in this small area and jump across the shutters to
reach Main Street once again. Now, jump along the canopies to reach the far end
and enter the Bazaar. In this area you have a chance at finding Black Fungi,
but you're here to get the # TODO: [TRINITY JUMP #11] # at the bottom of the area -- it
yields a # TODO: [MEGA-ETHER] #. Now climb up and jump across the shutters to reach a
# CHEST with [THUNDARA-G] # inside. Continue to make the climb and reach another
# CHEST, this one has a [FIRE RING] #. Now use the Keyhole to open a locked gate
and return to Main Street.

  Head to Aladdin's House to progress the story then head back to Main Street
after you've re-equipped the group and saved. Jump across to the yellow canopies
and enter the Palace Gates.

| T |  The Pot Scorpion spawns in the Palace Gates of Agrabah after you've    |

| O | strike the Pot Scorpion. The only way to hurt it is to Guard right when |
| R | it charges to claw you. It gets knocked unconscious for a moment so you |
| P | can damage it. You can negate the poison attack with Aeroga if you have |
| I | trouble dodging it. There's a 20% chance for the item to drop, it       |

  While fighting the Heartless here make sure not to fall. Once they have all
been defeated check the # CHEST for a [MEGA-ETHER] #. Head into the Hall and start
cleansing it of Heartless, remembering not to fall. When fighting the Green
Requiem and Yellow Operas just use magic because if you try to Aerial Combos
you'll likely fall. There is a barrel just before the three water spouts, jump
atop it to reach a platform with a # CHEST containing an [ELIXIR] #. Jump from
here down to the other half and up to another # CHEST # to acquire a [MYTHRIL
SHARD].

  At the beginning of this area you can see a pillar with a water spout that
bridges the gap to a set of stairs on the far end. Make the jump to reach the
Bottomless Hall and a # CHEST with another [MEGA-POTION] #. Head back to the
Hall and jump over to the exit, back into the Bottomless Hall. To your right is
a # CHEST with an [ELIXIR] # if you can make the crafty jump. Drop down after you
get the item and swim to the # TODO: [TRINITY JUMP #12] -- it spawns a [CHEST] # with a
# TODO: [THUNDARA-G] # inside.

The Treasure Room
�����������������
  Back at the Bottomless Hall you can jump atop the water spout to reach a
# CHEST with a [COTTAGE] #, you'll just have to fight the Pot Spiders and Shadows
for it. Enter the Treasure Room from here where there is a chance to spawn White
Mushrooms. Clear out the Heartless and use # TODO: [TRINITY CHARGE #4] # to receive a
# TODO: [MYTHRIL SHARD] # and a large sum of Munny. Jump atop the monument with the flames
under it to reach a green # CHEST with a [DEFENSE UP] # inside. You can jump from
here to the other # CHEST to acquire a [MYTHRIL SHARD] #. Jump over to the small
walkway for the last # CHEST in this area and to find [DALMATIANS 37, 38, & 39] #.

Chambers of Secrets
�������������������
  Head back to the Hall and take the steps to a stone platform that leads to
the Dark Chamber. Use the Save Point and swap Donald out for Aladdin, you must
have Aladdin to progress. Jump over to the # CHEST for a [COTTAGE] # then make
the other jump to find a # TODO: [TORN PAGE] in the [CHEST] #. Now drop down into the
water and swim to the Relic Chamber. Go up the steps to the # CHEST # containing
a # TODO: [THUNDER RING] # then make your way to the other end.

  Face the monkey statue and "Call" Abu to gain access to some new steps. If
you pushed the stone off the cliff earlier you can reach a # CHEST # with a
# TODO: [MYTHRIL] # inside. Head back into the Dark Chamber by using the steps you just
received access to and you'll spot a # CHEST with a [METEOR-G] # inside. Swim up
the waterfall (Yes, UP the waterfall) and call Abu again to lower the platform.
Grab the # TODO: [PROTERA CHAIN] from the [CHEST] # then swim up the waterfall near the
Save Point to enter the Silent Chamber.

  Head down the waterfall and call touch the statue then swim back up. Now swim
into the Hidden Room and jump-slash the pillar here. After the cutscene head
back to the Treasure Room. Call Abu on the statue near the Save Point to reach
a # CHEST with a [THUNDAGA-G] # inside. Save your game and head to the Lamp
Chamber when you're ready.

  Enter Chamber 1 to trigger another scene. Defeat the Search Ghosts and enter
Chamber 3 via the lower exit. Clear out the Fat Bodies and Search Ghosts in
here then open the # CHEST for a [MEGA-ETHER] #. Return to Chamber 1 and take the
other exit to reach Chamber 2. There are Air Soldiers and other Heartless in
here, just kill them and loot the # CHEST for a [COTTAGE] #. Head on to Chamber 3
again, but this time you're higher up. Try not to fall or break both of the
barrels.

  Use one of the barrels to reach a platform above you. It has a # CHEST # with
# TODO: [DALMATIANS 55, 56, & 57] # inside. From here you can jump across the gap to a
# CHEST with an [OSMOSE-G] and use the barrel on this side to reach the [CHEST] #
that's higher up, it has a # TODO: [FLARE-G] # inside. Jump back across and enter

and jump from one platform to the next to reach the # CHEST with a [MEGALIXIR] #

  Jump back across and fight through Chamber 5 to Chamber 6. Clear out the
Heartless and turn left to a # CHEST with [DALMATIANS 76, 77, & 78] # inside.
There is an exit right here back to Chamber 5, take it. Defeat the waves of
Heartless, lots of Shadows, then loot the # TODO: [CHESTS] for a [MEGA-ETHER] # and
# TODO: [THUNDAGA-G]. You can also use [TRINITY JUMP #13] to receive a [COTTAGE] # and
some Munny.

  Clear out the Heartless and use a barrel at the top of the final step to reach
a # CHEST on the upper platform, it contains a [TORN PAGE] #. There is an exit
right here back to Chamber 5, take it. Defeat the waves of Heartless, lots of
Shadows, then loot the # TODO: [CHESTS] for a [MEGA-ETHER] and [THUNDAGA-G] #. You can
also use # TODO: [TRINITY JUMP #13] to receive a [COTTAGE] # and some Munny. Climb up
using the barrel and defeat the Search Ghosts that appear.

  Grab the barrel and move it towards the exit. Press Circle to drop it instead
of throwing it and you can leap from the barrel to the ledge -- the # CHEST #
contains a # TODO: [MYTHRIL] #. Jump across to the new area and break the barrel to gain
access to the # CHEST, [DALMATIANS 79, 80, & 81] # inside. Jump back to the area
you start at and enter Chamber 4. Save your game after the scenes then proceed
into the Bowels for a boss fight.

  Swim over to the platform infront of Geppetto's Ship and climb up to another
# CHEST to acquire a [SCAN-G] #. From here jump to the central stack then to the
back end of the one you were just on. Climb up to the top for a # CHEST # that
contains a # TODO: [COTTAGE] #. Now, from where you got the Blue Trinity, make a long
jump over to a low platform. Climb up to the top to find a # CHEST # that is
hiding # TODO: [DALMATIANS 73, 74, & 75] #. Head back to Chamber 6 where you got the Torn
Page and make a jump and slash to reach a # CHEST with a [MEGALIXIR] #. Make
another similar jump to the ledge nearby. The # CHEST here contains a [MYTHRIL] #
and there is an exit back to Chamber 1.

Mushrooms and a Rematch

  From the mouth you'll need to climb up the wooden structures and reach the
door above the Chamber 1 entrance to enter the Throat. Use # TODO: [TRINITY JUMP #15] #
to get a # TODO: [MYTHRIL SHARD] # then climb up into Monstro's Stomach. Note: It is
possible to encounter Rare Truffles at this location.

  Visit Merlin now that you have learned all the magic spells there are and he
will hand over the # TODO: [SPELLBINDER] # Keyblade. You should also talk to the Fairy
Godmother if you haven't learned Dumbo and Bambi yet. Since you're here you
might as well check in on Pooh in the 100 Acre Wood (Section # TODO: [0501] #).

Agrabah
�������
  You can find a # CHEST # in Main Street near the entrance to the upper level of
the Palace Gates. Since you have High Jump, just reach the ledge and claim the
# TODO: [MYTHRIL] #. Enter the Palace Gates from here and High Jump directly left and up
to a # CHEST to find [DALMATIANS 52, 53, & 54] #. There is another chest across
the way but it's impossible to reach right now. Head to the Cave of Wonders and
in the Entrance clear out the Heartless. Move the barrel next to the raised
platform and High Jump off of it to reach a # CHEST # with [DALMATIANS 49, 50, &
51].

  Drop down into the water below and enter the Dark Chamber. Head over to the
Save Point and swim up the waterfall into the Silent Chamber. Now head up the
steps and High Jump to the ledge you revealed earlier in Agrabah. Touch the
statue to reveal two # TODO: [CHESTS]. Jump down and find [DALMATIANS 46, 47, & 48] # as
well as a # TODO: [HASTE2-G] #. With that your time in Agrabah is done, for now. You can
check out the Olympus Coliseum for the Pegasus Cup (Section # TODO: [0602] #) if you feel
confident in your abilities. You can also receive a Torn Page from Pongo and
Perdita and advance the 100 Acre Wood story (Section # TODO: [0501] #). This is a great
idea since you'll learn # TODO: [STOPRA] # if you've been keeping up.

  Hit the clamshell to open it and use the Save Point. Switch out Goofy for
Ariel since there are no Trinity Marks available to you in this world. Ariel
focuses on magic and clearly it's at an advantage in this area. Head out to the
Undersea Valley when you are ready.

Treasures of the Deep
���������������������
  Start by heading to the red shell in front of you. Clear the Heartless then
shoot it with a Fira spell to claim a # TODO: [MYTHRIL SHARD] #. Nearby is an alcove with
another clam shell, hit it with your Keyblade to claim the # TODO: [MEGA-ETHER] # inside.
Leave the alcove and descend to your left towards another clam shell. Clear the
Heartless that spawn and open this shell for a # TODO: [MEGA-POTION] #. From here there is
a somewhat hidden alcove that leads to another shell. To get to it, look up
from the shell to notice the opening on the underside of the cliff. The shell
here contains a # TODO: [MYTHRIL] #. Now swim across to the opposite side to find two more
shells -- an # TODO: [ELIXIR] and [COTTAGE] #.

  Follow the trident symbols to the Calm Depths. Go with the flow of the current
to fight some Search Ghosts then enter the Undersea Cave. Open the shell here
to acquire another # TODO: [COTTAGE] # then swim up. In the Undersea Gorge clear out the
Sea Neons then descend near the entrance to find a blue clam shell. Hit it with
Blizzara to acquire the # TODO: [MYTHRIL SHARD] #. Keep along the ocean floor to find
another clam shell. Hit it to get the # TODO: [MEGA-ETHER] # then continue along towards
Triton's Palace. Instead of entering here though, go to the left of it and
enter the Undersea Garden to find a clam with a # TODO: [MEGA-POTION] # inside.

To Triton's Palace
������������������
  Head back to the Gorge and into Triton's Palace. Clear out the Heartless and
descend near the entrance to reach a clam shell -- it holds a # TODO: [COTTAGE] #. There's
another clam shell on the ground to the right of the entrance. This one has a
# TODO: [MEGA-ETHER] # inside. From here you can see the yellow clam shell. Hit it with
Thunder and claim the # TODO: [MYTHRIL SHARD] #. Swim across the bridge to the opposite
end and hit the clam shell here for an # TODO: [ELIXIR] #. Enter Triton's Throne from here
to start a cutscene.

| T |  The Sheltering Zone is a giant version of the Sea Neon. It moves much  |

| I | will split into three Sea Neons. You'll want to take this guy out last  |
| N | since it's usually grouped with Screwdivers and adding three more Sea   |
| G | Neons to the fray isn't a good idea. If you defeat the Sheltering Zone  |
|   | with a Fire attack then it won't split into Sea Neons and you'll        |

  Head back to the Sunken Ship and turn left to the front end of a smaller ship
smashed against the wall. Behind it you can examine a switch that Sebastian can
reach. This gives you access to the Den of Tides. Defeat the Search Ghosts then
stay right at the fork to reach the Cavern Nook. Open the clam shells for a
# TODO: [MEGA-ETHER] # and a Save Point then head down the other path to find Ursula.

  You learn the Shared Ability # TODO: [MERMAID KICK] # after the battle, be sure to
equip it! Leave Ursula's Lair and then head back in. Blow up the sea urchin and
the nearby clam will drop a # CHEST containing [MYTHRIL] #. Head out and save then
go to the Calm Depths and swim against the current to reach an unknown location
where Ursula awaits for a rematch.

  Head to the Battle LV 6 world to reach Halloween Town. Save then enter the
Guillotine Square where Search Ghosts are just sitting around, not attacking at
all. Head up the steps towards Dr. Finkelstein's Lab to have an introduction
play. Enter the Lab Entryway then into the Research Lab. After the scenes check
the bookshelf for a # TODO: [TORN PAGE] # then go back outside.

  Go under the steps at Jack's house (through the gate to your left) to find a
# CHEST with a [THUNDARA-G] #. Pull the spider at the door three times to receive
an # TODO: [ELIXIR] #. To the right of Jack's house is the entrance to the Graveyard. You
will end up fighting a new Heartless here.

After Oogie Boogie
������������������
  Follow Zero out to the Graveyard. Go through the casket once more and then
into a door around the giant pumpkin. On Moonlight Hill you have a chance at
spawning the Black Fungi again, but chances are there's a ton of Heartless.
Clear them out and check the gravestone at the top of the hill and it will
unfurl leading out to the Bridge. This area throws you into a ton of Heartless,
just accept that you need to beat them and do so. Open the # CHEST # underneath
the bridge for a # TODO: [FLARE-G] #. Climb back up and jump to the left side of the
bridge to net a # TODO: [METEOR-G] from the [CHEST]. You can reach the [CHEST] # on the
opposite side if you jump from the small ledge. You'll get stuck just short of
the chest but you can climb up with another jump to claim the # TODO: [DEFENSE UP] #.

  Enter Oogie's Manor and fight off the Heartless. Open the small # CHEST # for
an # TODO: [ETHER] then head inside. Loot the [CHEST] here for another [ETHER] # then
light the platform with a Fira. Jump up to reach the outside of the manor.
Fight around until you head up the steps to a broken tower. Turn left and jump
atop the roof of the jagged wall then jump from here to the cage. Loot the
# CHEST for a [MEGA-ETHER] # and continue back the other way until you enter the
Evil Playroom.

way to the bottom. Jump down to it and claim the # TODO: [ORICHALCUM] from the [CHEST] #.
Use the elevator to head to the base of the mansion then enter the Torture

| Weak: N/A                         | are regular dice that determine how the |
| Resist: N/A                       | blades are going to spin, or whether    |
| Drop: N/A                         | toy soldiers or buzz saws are going to  |
| Experience: 2500                  | come after you. These dice can be hit   |
|-----------------------------------' and deflected for a bunch of Tech Point |
| experience points. It's also good for avoiding an attack all together. The  |
| other kind of dice are explosive and they hurt, run away from them. When    |
| the symbols around the circle light up step on the one where Oogie Boogie   |
| is located and the fence will rise trapping you with him. This gives you an |
| opportunity to damage Oogie Boogie. You'll have to do this cycle three or   |

|-----------------------------------' way in addition to two lanterns that    |

| R | to reflect how much damage he needs to take before going unconscious.   |
| A | When he goes unconscious little beams of bouncing energy go around the  |
|   | area. Deflect them back to deal damage to Chimera. There is 35% of it   |
|   | dropping an item when defeated, 20% if you deflect 6 beams, and 40% if  |
|   | if you deflect them 9 times. Casting Aeroga and staying near Chimera    |

Fighting with Yourself
����������������������
  Head out to the Hold then up the ladder and into the next room. Jump down
into the hole and fight off the waves of Pirates. Climb up the other ladder
to start a scene. Open the # CHEST in the corner for a [METEOR-G] # then use
the shelf on the wall to jump up through the hole in the grated ceiling. Enter
the next room and use # TODO: [TRINITY LADDER #8] # to lower a ladder. Climb up it to
reach a new area.

|-----------------------------------' the real one, but take out the fakes    |

Getting Hooked Up
�����������������
  After the battle open the # CHEST to release [DALMATIANS 88, 89, & 90] #. There
is a hatch on the floor that leads down to the Cabin. Loot the # CHEST # here for
a # TODO: [PROTERA CHAIN] # then exit the room. Head into the adjacent room and back to
the Captain's Cabin. Exit out to the deck to trigger a scene. You will learn
# TODO: [CURA] # and have a chance to change party members. You'll also be facing two new
enemies in the ensuing battle.

| Resist: N/A                       | uses a move called Ars Arcanum and it   |
| Drop: N/A                         | can deal a lot of damage. To avoid it,  |
| Experience: 3400                  | just fly away. The one thing you need   |
|-----------------------------------' to avoid is casting Fira on the Captain |
| because it'll cause him to run around the ship and he'll likely run into    |
| you causing damage. Hook might present a bunch of HP but it's too easy to   |
| just avoid the big damage by flying away. It could be a longer fight, but   |

  You learn # TODO: [ARS ARCANUM] and get [ANSEM'S REPORT 9] # for winning the fight.
Tinker Bell comes calling you to the Clock Tower to which you are taken. Open

adjust the clock that says 11:45 until it reads 12:00. After the Keyhole is
sealed you receive a # TODO: [NAVI-G PIECE], the [TINKER BELL] summon, the [FAIRY HARP] #
Keyblade, and # TODO: [GLIDE] #. Leave Neverland and then land again at the Cabin. Make
your way down to the Hold and fly up above the support beams to find a # CHEST #
with a # TODO: [PAPER-G] inside. Check the opposite end of the beam for another [CHEST] #

  Before you can go to Hollow Bastion you need to talk to Cid at Traverse Town.
He'll give you the # TODO: [TRANSFORM-G] # you need to reach the next area. Head to the

  Head to the Palace Gates and jump to the highest platform. Glide across to
the # CHEST for an [OSMOSE-G] #. If you head to the Hall at the Cave of Wonders
you can find # TODO: [TRINITY PUSH #3] # and push the giant head into the pit. It would
be used to reach some chests, but you should have claimed them earlier with
High Jump.

Halloween Town
��������������
  In Guillotine Square you can jump on a ledge next to the Lab Entranceway.
Jump and Glide away from the entranceway to another ledge. From here you can
jump into the pumpkin to find a # TODO: [POWER UP] within the [CHEST] #. There are two
more # TODO: [CHESTS] # in the giant mouth to the right. Glide there and claim [DALMATIANS
70, 71, & 72] and an # TODO: [ELIXIR] #.

  Venture to Moonlight Hill and enter the cemetery from the right side. Search
around to find a bunch of # TODO: [CHESTS] -- a [DARK MATTER], [DALMATIANS 64, 65, & 66] #
a # TODO: [HOLY-G], and a [SCISSORS-G] #.

Neverland
���������
  Head to the Clock Tower and check what time the clock says. It corresponds
with the game time and you'll be able to open a door based on what time it is.
Game time 1-12 hours would open the doors 1-12 but as time progresses you'll
need to figure out what time it will be in game. Example; the game clock reads
as 33:41:20 so the clock will read 9:41:20 and the 9:00 door will be lit and
available for opening.

|�������|���������������|  You can also head to the Hold and use [TRINITY PUSH
| TIME  | REWARD        | #4] to enter a room with plenty of goodies. Open the
|=======|===============| # TODO: [CHESTS] in this room to claim a {DARK MATTER] #, an

  If you drop down onto the water you can walk on it. Jump over the first set
of rocks to spot a # CHEST with a [LIFE-G] # inside. Head back to the starting
platform and use Blizzara to freeze the bubbles. Jump from them up to a # CHEST #
with # TODO: [DALMATIANS 91, 92, & 93] #. Glide from here to a central location and freeze
the bubble here. Hope up to another platform and claim the # TODO: [BLIZZARA RING] # from
the # CHEST #. Now jump into the bubble you just froze to go underwater and find
another # CHEST with a [METEOR-G] # inside.

  Head back up the platforms until a scene takes over. Donald and Goofy leave,
Beast joins, and Sora is without the Keyblade. Glide over to the # CHEST # behind
you for a # TODO: [MEGALIXIR] # then climb up to the Castle Gates where you'll surely find
new enemies.

Entering the Castle
�������������������
  Turn right from the entrance and go through the gate. Examine the red lit up
crystal then the blue one to be taken lower. Let Beast take out the Darkballs
then jump into the bubble on the left that's off the water. Jump up to the
# CHEST to claim a [MYTHRIL] then across to another [CHEST] for a [THUNDARA-G] #.
Use the crystal here and a platform slides out. Jump and Glide across the
platforms back to where you entered this zone to find a # TODO: [PAPER-G] # inside the
# CHEST # on the ledge.

  Return to the area with the movable block and push it so you can reach the
platform opposite the entrance. Use the crystal here to extend another platform
then cross them to reach the Waterway. Call Beast to break the gate and take the
# TODO: [THUNDAGA-G] from the [CHEST] #. Head back to the Base Level and use the other
bubble. Open the # CHEST for a [FIRA RING] # then utilize the Save Point. Freeze
the bubble on the other side with Blizzara and jump on it then to a ledge up
high. Open the # CHEST for a well-earned [DARK MATTER] #. Now use the bubble you
just froze to reach another section of the Waterway.

  Have Beast break the stone wall and defeat the Heartless in the Dungeon. Open
the # TODO: [CHESTS] to claim an [ULTIMA-G] and [THUNDAGA-G] #, then make a mental note
of the Trinity Jump in this room. Leave the Dungeon and button hook left to a
switch, release it. Move up and press another switch to move the gates again,
then use yet another switch to reveal the final switch, that when pressed grants
to access the next section. Use the bubble here to hit another switch that
raises a platform to a Defender. Distract it so Beast gets a back attack then
release the switch. Return to the Castle Gates by using the switches in reverse
order and enter the Entrance Hall.

| Weak: N/A                         | with combos and jumps away when you hit |

|-----------------------------------' are having trouble but you should be    |
| able to just hack and slash your way to victory. A Dodge Roll here and      |
| there will help avoid some of his attacks and leaves Riku open for a solid  |

The Greatest Puzzle of Them All
�������������������������������
  You learned # TODO: [TRINITY DETECT] # which will be used on the White Trinity Marks
around the worlds, but for now you need to clear Hollow Bastion. Head up the
steps and into the room with the Heartless Symbol. On the right pillar is a
small ledge you can grab onto and reach the upper level. Open the # CHEST # on
the opposite pillar for an # TODO: [AP UP] #. Exit to the right and enter the Library.
Pick up the red book on the ground, # TODO: [KHAMA VOL. 8] #. Place it into the empty
slot on the bookshelf with the red books and the wall slides. Now check the
pillar to your left and spin it twice to get the # CHEST and the [ELIXIR] # inside
of it.

  Head up the stairs to find two similar pillars. Turn the first one four times
and open the # CHEST for a [MYTHRIL] #. Turn the second one five times and open
the # CHEST for a [MEGA-POTION]. Pick up [THEON VOL. 6] # from the desk near the
Save Point then use # TODO: [TRINITY LADDER #9] to reach [AZAL VOL. 3] #. Now take [MAVA
VOL. 6] out of the orange slot and place Theon vol. 6 in it's place. Press the
switch to unlock the door on the second level. Now jump across the top of the
bookcases and open the # CHEST for an [ULTIMA-G] # then walk over to another
pillar that spins. Spin it twice and claim the # TODO: [AP UP] from the [CHEST] #.

  If you drop down between the bookcases in front of the Save Point you'll reach
a new section. Take # TODO: [SALEGG VOL. 6] # from amidst the green books then place it
with the blue books behind you. Now run back to the entrance and place Azal
vol. 3 with the yellow books. Run in a circle to come back to the bookcase you
just moved and claim # TODO: [NAHARA VOL. 5] #. Place it with the yellow books on the
second floor to find # TODO: [MAVA VOL. 3] # with the purple books. Drop back down to
where you grabbed Salegg vol. 6 from the green books and place the correct two.
Grab # TODO: [HAFET VOL. 4] # off the table in the new room and place with the purple
books.

  Enter the Lift Stop and cast Gravira on the floating platform holding a
# CHEST then release [DALMATIANS 97, 98, & 99] #. Use the blue crystal to ride up
to a new area and use Gravira on the # CHEST again. Take the [OSMOSE-G] # then
return to the Library. You might want to heal and save before continuing out the
door on the second floor.

Opening the Heartless Door
��������������������������
  Head right and break the two pots nearby to have an # TODO: [EMBLEM PIECE] # drop out
into the fountain. Don't get it yet, instead move around the room and light the
eight candles on fire. Near the last set of candles is a stone with a lightning
bolt. Cast Thundara then jump to the central area and claim an # TODO: [EMBLEM PIECE] #.
Opposite the Library door is a statue that can be pushed into place, doing so
creates a # CHEST on the first floor. Now head over to [TRINITY CHARGE #6] # to
knock a statue over and reveal another # TODO: [EMBLEM PIECE] #. Jump down and grab the
two pieces in the center then open the chest that you revealed for the final
# TODO: [EMBLEM PIECE] #. Place all the pieces on the Heartless Door to start a cutscene.

From the Top to the Bottom
��������������������������
  Enter the Lift Stop and hit the red crystal to change it blue. Use the first
blue crystal to go up. Use Gravira on the # CHEST to obtain an [ORICHALCUM] #,
then head back down. Change the crystal back to red and ride the elevator again,
this time down. Enter the Waterway and defeat the Heartless, then take the right
platform to find a red crystal. Examine it for a # TODO: [MYTHRIL] # then head back down
and take the other platform to reach the Dungeon. Clear out the Heartless and
use # TODO: [TRINITY JUMP #16] to obtain a [MEGA-ETHER], [COTTAGE], and [MEGA-POTION] #.

  Return to the initial platform in the Lift Stop and exit past the red crystal
into the Castle Gates. Be careful here since if you fall you'll have a nice
little trip back up. Let the Wyverns come to you and defeat them then hit the
red crystal. Use the newly moving platform to reach another # CHEST # that you
must use Gravira on, it contains # TODO: [DALMATIANS 94, 95, & 96] #. Now ride the moving
platform back to the opposite end and jump on the other one. Ride this to a
# CHEST containing [HASTE2-G]. Glide from here to another [CHEST] # on the pillar
for an # TODO: [ORICHALCUM] #.

Bottom to Top, I Stop
���������������������
  Cross back over to the original platform and use the blue crystal. Move up
the steps to a red crystal that teleports you to a platform. It moves to the
opposite end of the castle but Heartless appear to impede your progress. Beat
them and hit the crystal again to continue. Use # TODO: [TRINITY JUMP #17] # to obtain
a # TODO: [MEGALIXIR] and two [COTTAGES] then open the [CHEST] for a [THUNDAGA-G] #. Head
down the steps and back into the Lift Stop. Use the blue crystal to move up then
enter the Great Crest. Open the # CHEST # to the left as you enter for an
# TODO: [ORICHALCUM] #. Use another blue crystal to reach a higher location.

  Defeat the Heartless and use Gravira to grab the # TODO: [THUNDARA RING] # from the
# CHEST #. Jump off the platform near the blue crystal and Glide to the right so
you go underneath the area to hidden section of the Lift Stop. Use Gravira and
open the # CHEST for a [ROYAL CROWN] #, well done. Head back to the High Tower and
jump off and Glide left then just drop, it takes you back one area. Return to
the High Tower again and use the red crystal then enter the Lift Stop behind
you. Fight through this area back to the High Tower where more Heartless await.
Use Gravira to lower the # CHEST and obtain an [OSMOSE-G] #.

  Use the red crystal and climb up the steps to another one. From here you can
climb the steps again to a # CHEST with a [MEGALIXIR] #. Examine the red crystal
on this ledge to open a way back to the Library. Hop down the steps now and
enter the Lift Stop to reach the Castle Chapel.

| Weak: N/A                         | so you can hit Maleficent who will try  |
| Resist: N/A                       | to hit you away with her staff. She can |
| Drop: N/A                         | also summon Defenders and Darkballs to  |
| Experience: 3400                  | the battlefield to assist her. You'll   |
|-----------------------------------' want to deal with the Darkballs, the    |
| Defenders shouldn't be too much of a bother. When Maleficent shouts she     |
| will summon a meteor shower that goes down the middle of the battlefield,   |
| so get wide of it or take some damage. Summon Tinker Bell and use Aerora    |
| to help mitigate the threat and if you're feeling brash just use Ars        |
| Arcanum a few times to really put a dent in Maleficent's HP.                |

| BOSS: Dragon                                                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HP: 1200                          |  This battle is one of the harder ones  |
| Attack: 31                        | in the game. Using Tinker Bell and      |
| Defense: 24                       | Aerora is a viable strategy if you just |
| Weak: N/A                         | want to get up in the Dragon's face and |
| Resist: N/A                       | wail on it. You'll still need to be     |
| Drop: N/A                         | cautious of your health but you can do  |
| Experience: 6000                  | a lot of damage with this formula.      |
|-----------------------------------' Regardless of your approach, you need   |
| know what can kill you. When the Dragon stomps it creates a shockwave       |
| through the entire room so you'll need to jump. Maleficent can also breath  |
| a green fire on the ground that continues to burn. This all comes in        |
| addition claw swipes and bite attacks. There is also a nasty homing green   |
| fireball that you'll have to deal with, though it can be parried for quite  |
| a large number of Tech Points. The basic strategy is to Glide in and hit    |
| the Dragon after it breathes fire. Take the weak hits from the claws and    |
| when the homing fireball is coming after you parry it. You'll be able to    |
| stay out of the fiery floor area and slowly nitpick damage. Likewise, a     |
| reliable way for victory is to reach Maleficent's back and attack her head  |
| for here. Strike Raid is a great ability for this particular approach.      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 �����������������������������������������������������������������������������
  After the battle you receive the # TODO: [FIREGLOW] #. Head back through the portal
and save again. Move through the Lift Stop into the Grand Hall. Proceed up the
stairs and another battle begins. You'll want to equip any Dark Resistant gear
you have to lessen the damage you'll take.
 _____________________________________________________________________________

| BOSS: Riku-Ansem                                                            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HP: 900                           |  The difficulty doesn't drop for this   |
| Attack: 31                        | rematch. Darkness has taken over this   |
| Defense: 24                       | former ally and he's a lot tougher than |
| Weak: N/A                         | earlier. Donald and Goofy are not       |
| Resist: N/A                       | available for this fight so you'll have |
| Drop: N/A                         | to rely on Aerora and Cura to keep Sora |
| Experience: 8500                  | in good health. Riku still uses a three |
|-----------------------------------' hit combo that can be Guarded. This     |
| leaves him open for a full combo. Normally, he'll try to counter attack     |
| right back so prepare to Guard again and you can get another combination in |
| for more damage. Rarely, Riku will throw his Keyblade at you. Either Dodge  |
| Roll or Guard, though the latter can be difficult. When Riku moves to the   |
| center of the room and says, "Behold the power of darkness" you'll want to  |
| start Gliding around the outside of the room to avoid his Dark Aura attack. |
| You'll want to wait until he finishes in the center before running in to    |
| strike. Dark Aura will be used more frequently when Riku drops under 300    |
| HP, so you'll want to really put up some damage then. Ars Arcanum, when     |
| used midway through a combo, is a great way to deal a ton of damage quickly.|
| Whatever you do, don't cast Fira on Riku -- he casts it backs as Dark Fire  |
| and it really hurts if you get hit.                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

  After the battle you receive # TODO: [RAGNAROK] #. Head back to the Entrance Hall after
the scene, it's fastest if you just drop off the ledges. Another scene takes

  The door here leads to the final boss and as such is a point of no return. Do
not enter this door unless you are prepared to beat the game. You can return to
other worlds and collect other items, etc. Open the # CHEST for a [MEGALIXIR] #
then proceed how you want. Here's a list of the things that you can still do:

# TODO: [0504] # Gummi Ship

# TODO: [0506] # Item Synthesis
# TODO: [0604] # Hades Cup
# TODO: [0605] # Gold Match
# TODO: [0606] # Platinum Match

  In addition to these you can continue to level up and grow stronger. You can
also gather any Trinity Marks # TODO: [0502] or Dalmatians [0503] # you've missed. Try to
complete the Journal, it will have a gold Mickey to signify you've completed it.
When you do step through the door you arrive in Destiny Islands. Head to the
Secret Place to start a cutscene then fly over to Ansem to start the battle.

| Drop: N/A                         | Dodge Roll away. The Guardian will also |
| Experience: 10000                 | phase through Ansem and attempt to hit  |
|-----------------------------------' you, again Dodge Roll or Guard. The     |
| attack here that really gets annoying and can get you hurt is when Ansem    |
| says, "Submit!" The Guardian will then lash out towards you and if he       |
| connects then you are possessed. The Attack command will change to Freeze   |
| periodically and if you hit Freeze the Guardian grabs you and Ansem will    |
| hit you pretty hard. The key to breaking free of this is to either run far  |
| away and just Freeze so Ansem can't reach you, or use an ability like Ars   |
| Arcanum or Ragnarok to deal a bunch of damage without having to use Attack. |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

  After you beat Ansem he simply flies away to a crater. Stock up on healing
items and anything else you might need before chasing after Ansem because once
you start the next battle you'll be at it until the game ends. Donald and Goofy
won't be able to make it through the barrier Ansem puts up. Then it gets worse,
Ansem resummons Darkside.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HP: 900                    |  This time around Darkside is a little bit     |
| Attack: 40                 | stronger. It stills uses the Summon Shadow     |
| Defense: 30                | attack where it plunges its fist into the      |
| Weak: N/A                  | ground. There is also the Darkness Rain where  |
| Resist: N/A                | Darkside picks up a ball of darkness and has   |
| Drop: N/A                  | it burst into little balls. Then there is the  |
| Experience: 8000           | homing Dark Fire attack that it shoots from    |
|----------------------------' its chest. The battle is pretty much the same  |
| as the second time you fought Darkside so using those tactics again works   |
| out just fine.                                                              |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HP: 1500                          |  Ansem's attacks have changed a little  |
| Attack: 40                        | bit this time. He uses an attack that   |
| Defense: 30                       | similar to Riku's Dark Aura, where he   |
| Weak: N/A                         | dashes around the arena inflicting      |
| Resist: N/A                       | heavy damage. Avoid this like you did   |
| Drop: N/A                         | before, jump up and Glide around until  |
| Experience: 20000                 | he's done. Ansem will also say, "My     |
|-----------------------------------' strength returns!" and the Guardian     |
| will dive into the ground. Pools of darkness are created under Sora and     |
| then the Guardian shoots out of them, so be sure to constantly move. There  |
| is still the "Submit!" where the Guardian will possess you but outside of   |
| that the only difficult thing is finding a spot to get some damage in.      |
| During possession use skills and before/after his Dark Aura are great times |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HP: 1500                          |  The World of Chaos might seem a bit    |
| Attack: 40                        | overwhelming, but you'll be taking it   |
| Defense: 30                       | down in sections so don't fret! Start   |
| Weak: N/A                         | with attacking Ansem. He wields a large |
| Resist: N/A                       | double-bladed Soul Eater, can summon    |
| Drop: N/A                         | Bit Snipers, and can fire lasers. Put   |
| Experience: 20000                 | up Aeroga and let Ansem have it until   |
|-----------------------------------' the lasers come, at which point you     |
| should just fly away. Come back once they're gone and just focus on beating |
| down Ansem. He doesn't attack much so you won't take much damage and it's   |
| simple to fly away and heal. In fact, if you fly really high up into the    |
| air you can fight some Bit Snipers to quickly regain health. Once Ansem is  |
| defeated he'll protect himself during a short scene and become invulnerable |
| until later.                                                                |

|  A Portal to Darkness appears at this point and Sora flies through it.      |
| Fight off the Shadows and break the Room Core to return to the outside.     |
| Another Portal to Darkness appears and this time you'll have to fly into    |
| it. Inside you find plenty of Darkballs, but also Goofy. Defeat the Heart-  |
| less and then the Room Core to escape with Goofy. The Face becomes a target |
| at this point, but you'll want to destroy the artillery off to the sides    |
| first. The Face has 1200 HP so you'll be hitting it for a while. It has a   |
| chomp and energy blast attack that are pretty strong but using Aeroga and   |
| a Curaga now and again makes it simple. Once defeated, the final Portal to  |
| Darkness appears. Clear out the Invisibles to save Donald then break the    |
| Room Core to break the barrier protecting the Main Core.                    |
|                                                                             |
|  Head to the central area and clear the Artillery then destroy the Main     |
| Core. Ansem will break the seal he created to attempt to prevent you from   |
| destroying the World of Chaos. He fights just like earlier in the battle    |
| but adds a move where he uses a Dark Void to draw the party in and then     |
| create an explosion to damage you. Again, keep Aeroga running to mitigate   |
| damage and dodge lasers then focus on damaging Ansem.                       |

Welcome to the 100 Acre Wood
����������������������������
  This world is first accessible after you give Merlin the Old Book from Cid.
Head to the Magician's Study and read the book to be taken into it! The 100 Acre
Wood is different from other worlds in that it is unlocked in stages throughout
the game by collecting the Torn Pages that were scattered across the universe.
As you find the Torn Pages you can return to the 100 Acre Wood to discover a new
area is available with new characters. You can find the Torn Pages at the
following locations:

 Traverse Town - Reward for finding 51 Dalmatians
 Agrabah - Found in a chest in the Dark Chamber
 Monstro - Found in a chest in Chamber 6
 Atlantica - On a shelf in Ariel's Grotto
 Halloween Town - On the bookshelf in the Lab

Saying Goodbye to Pooh?
�����������������������
  Head to the Wood: Meadow to find Winnie the Pooh thinking on a log. After
talking to Pooh, check inside the log for a # CHEST with a [MYTHRIL SHARD] #
inside. Leave and head to Pooh's House. Head around back and hit the chimney
then enter the house. Pick up the # TODO: [MEGA-ETHER] # you knocked down then check the
cabinet for an # TODO: [ELIXIR] #. Leave the house and get an explanation from Owl about
this world. You can return when you have more pages since new areas will open up
then.

Pooh's Hunny Hunt
�����������������
  With a Torn Page in hand, head back to the 100 Acre Wood. Check the tree at
the top of the book to find Piglet. You have to run around the tree to sneak
up and talk to him. Pooh comes in and if you talk to him you'll start a mini-
game.

  Pooh will fly up and get honey from the tree. This causes bees to try and
attack him. The nature of this game is to not move around a whole lot. Stay on
an even level with Pooh and when bees come near just lock on and swing the
Keyblade once. Sora will automatically jump and land back on the branch if you
don't move. It shouldn't bee too hard to achieve a score higher than 100 in
this game.

  After completing the mini-game, regardless of your score, you receive the
# TODO: [NATURESPARK] # which you can give to the Fairy Godmother

Rabbit's House
��������������
  With another Torn Page in hand, go to Rabbit's House in the 100 Acre Wood.
Check the front door and mailbox for a few notes from Rabbit, then head around
back to find Pooh and Piglet. Enter the house and check the roots in the
ceiling to find a pot of honey. Head all the way out of the area now, only to
be stopped by Piglet. It seems Pooh has gotten himself stuck. Talk to him from
outside and Tigger will come in. Time for another mini-game.

  This game isn't all that difficult. Simply stand on a carrot to have the Rush
command become available. When Tigger leaps into the air use it and you'll land
underneath him, preventing a carrot from being smashed. Just re-adjust on the
carrot you guarded for the Rush command to re-appear and continue this pattern
for a minute.

  Head back inside and Pooh will get unstuck. The Torn Page turns into a
# TODO: [MYTHRIL SHARD] # for your hard work.

Pooh's Swing
������������
  You should be able to get a Torn Page from turning in Dalmatians. That will
open up this area in the 100 Acre Wood. Jump in the water and grab Eeyore then
target Pooh and walk him up the hill. Once you reach the swing the Mini-game
starts.

  Press R1 when Owl opens his wings to push Pooh at the perfect time. This will
get the maximum distance and Pooh will fly pretty far. The best timing is right
when Owl is starting to close his wings. It shouldn't be too hard to break 40m
in this challenge.

  For your efforts you'll learn the # TODO: [STOPRA] # spell.

Tigger's Giant Pot
������������������
  With the Torn Page from Atlantica you can enter the clearing to the right of
Pooh's House. Talk to Tigger and agree to bounce with him. Jump across the
stumps and talk to Tigger again. Again, jump across the stumps in the order that
Tigger and Roo do. For the last one jump on the seesaw then drop down and jump
across the stumps to Tigger. It's easier if you just fall from the tree after
lining yourself up.

  Talk to Tigger again and then Roo. The trick here is to knock the nuts back
at the pot but you score higher if you hit the nut at the peak of it's
trajectory so you'll want to jump up and swing with your longest Keyblade to
hit it from as high as possible. You can get upto 6 points per swing if you're
pretty good.

  There's a ton of items to get in this area. Jump into the hole where the pot
was to find a # CHEST with an [AP UP] #. Jump out and move near Pooh to spot a
# TODO: [MYTHRIL] # inside the log, just break it to claim the item. Talk to Tigger then
meet him at the seesaw, ask him to be your partner. Jump up to the top of the
tree you land on and jump over to a tree with a hole in it (you can land on
the leafy canopy). Jump over to the # CHEST for a [MYTHRIL SHARD] # then back over
to go in the hole and knock loose a # TODO: [SHIELD2-G] #. Now head back and use Roo to
reach a new area. Grab the # TODO: [RARE NUT] # then jump off and land underneath where
you just were to find a # CHEST #. This is best accomplished by jumping off and
swinging your Keyblade to get in. Claim the # TODO: [DARK MATTER] # and head to Owl.

  Owl will take the Rare Nut and give a # TODO: [POWER UP] #. Use Roo again to claim the
second # TODO: [RARE NUT] from the same spot, it's exchanged for a [DEFENSE UP] #. From
here run past Tigger and Roo to a small stump. Step on it and turn around to
notice a geyser granting access to another # TODO: [RARE NUT] #. Exchange this for a
# TODO: [MYTHRIL SHARD] # then use Tigger again. From here jump to the other tree and
look down to the next # TODO: [RARE NUT]. Trade this one for an [AP UP] # then step on
the stump near Piglet and climb up to the hill. Jump from here to the wood then
turn around and jump atop the canopy to claim the last # TODO: [RARE NUT] # which turns
in for an # TODO: [ORICHALCUM]. When you leave you'll receive a [MYTHRIL] # for clearing
this area.

Pooh's Muddy Path
�����������������
  You just need to find all of Pooh's friends. Target Pooh and walk around the
bush until you can examine the leaves to reveal Eeyore. Now head back the other
way and find Roo atop a root. Talk to him then use the well to woosh up to the
ledge and talk to Tigger. Now lead Pooh over to the blue flowers and he'll come
up to where Tigger was. Shoot the beehive with a Fira spell and it clogs the
hole for Pooh. Target him and walk across the log bridge. Lead him to another
set of blue flowers to reach Piglet inside the tree. Now talk to Owl and then
drop down. Talk to Piglet then Rabbit and you'll clear the event. The Torn Page
turns into an # TODO: [EXP RING] #. If you return to Pooh's House and light the wood pile
on fire you'll receive a # TODO: [MYTHRIL] #.

Three Cheers for Mini-Games
���������������������������
  Meet the following credentials on the Mini-Games and you can talk to Owl at
Pooh's House to receive {CHEER]. Owl will tell you thanks for each one you've
completed so you'll know where you missed out. Likewise, check your scores in
the Mini Game section of the Journal.

Pongo and Perdita
�����������������
  If you visit Pong and Perdita at the Dalmatians' House in Traverse Town you'll
learn that their 99 Dalmatians have gone missing, scattered amongst the Worlds.
Throughout the course of the game you'll be able to find them in chests (because
that makes sense) and for every few that you collect (they come three at time)
you can check back in for a reward. Rewards are cumulative so if you wait to
collect them all before checking in you'll still get everything.

Flying Between Worlds
���������������������
  When you leave Traverse Town it'll be in a Gummi Ship. This is how you travel
around the worlds of Kingdom Hearts. You can customize a ship, purchase blue-
prints, and participate in Gummi Ship Missions to further expand your prowess
at defeating the Heartless while flying between worlds. One of the first things
you'll want to do when getting the Gummi Ship is to check out the tutorial on
how to build ships. All ships need a cockpit and an engine, from there just add
what you feel is necessary. Wings to turn faster, weapons to destroy, and even
decorative items.

Upgrading the Gummi Ship
������������������������
  Not everything is available at the start, you have to unlock certain things
as you go. For instance, Cid won't start selling gummis until you return to
Traverse Town after acquiring the Navi-G Pieces.
|����������|������|��������|���������������������������������������������������|

| COM. LV3 | 1000 | AGRABA | 10 Blueprints, 200 Blocks, Power Level 8          |
|__________|______|________|___________________________________________________|

* RIKU 2 - Defeat Riku for the second time at Hollow Bastion
* AGRABA - Lock Agrabah's Keyhole

Collecting Blueprints
���������������������
  There are a lot of blueprints available in the game and there's a lot of ways
to go about collecting them.

Gummi Ship Missions
�������������������
  Most of these are unlocked as you go, so you can complete them as you play
but it's recommended to wait until you've collected all the Dalmatians and have
a full gummi set to tinker with. After completing all the missions, press the
Triangle button to reach the Gummi Ship Mission screen. Chip and Dale interrupt
to congratulate you with a # TODO: [BAHAMUT] blueprint and [CROWN-G] #.

| is to put a Transform-G on this Gummi Ship and then clone it, linking it to  |
| it's clone. You'll want this for the beginning of the mission where there is |

| Neverland with a Gummi Ship that has 10 Thunder-G and a Transform-G to morph |
| into another Gummi Ship with 6 Meteor-G and 4 Ultima-G. Start off by blowing |
| up all the ships at the beginning and through the first asteroid field. You  |
| should come through with about 100 points, so focus on breaking some of the  |
| obstacles to score higher. After this you'll move between two large purple   |
| boulders that cannot be destroyed. Focus on destroying the smaller ships and |
| leave the stronger ones alone. Enemies will come out of the next set of      |
| purple boulders, so you can get 8 easy points off of them. The next part is  |
| a make or break area, you need to score high coming through here to get      |
| close to 200. There is a lot of ships before you reach an area with a ton of |
| Special blocks, just make sure you come out with a lot of points. When you   |
| clear the final area with the Specials, transform and start moving through   |
| the narrow area. Use your lasers to lock onto blocks that are hidden up in   |
| the ceiling and you can score a bunch of points easily without the fear of   |
| grabbing them. Once you achieved 260 points just coast till the end.         |

Phantom

  The first optional boss that you'll want to fight is Phantom. Head off to
Neverland and notice how you cannot land at the Clock Tower. Instead land in the

go with her to investigate the Clock Tower. After a short scene you'll be thrown

        | Phantom is based on Lord Ombra from "Peter and the Shadow   |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HP: 1200                   |  This fight can be difficult so you'll need    |
| Attack: 42                 | some preparation. Gear up with MP increasing   |
| Defense: 34                | Accessories and Keyblade, also stock up on     |
| Weak: N/A                  | Ethers and Elixirs just to be safe. The key to |
| Resist: N/A                | beating Phantom is to cast Stopra on the clock |
| Drop: Stopga               | at the start of the battle. This is because    |
| Experience: 9999           | Phantom casts Doom on one of your allies. The  |
|----------------------------' counter starts at 12 and if it reaches 0 that  |
| ally loses it's heart, but using Stopra on the clock also stops the Doom    |
| countdown. With the most crucial part of the battle out of the way, you     |
| need to move on to how to damage Phantom. There is an orb at the base of    |
| Phantom that changes colors and that's your indication of what attack to    |
| use. Red means Fire, Blue means Blizzard, Yellow means Thunder, and White   |
| means a Physical attack. As you can see, having items and MP regen          |
| abilities will be helpful. Also, mapping at least two of these spells to    |
| your quick keys will help.                                                  |
|                                                                             |
|  Phantom will take three hits before the orb breaks and usually try to      |
| claw you. The Heartless then moves towards the clock and begins to cast a   |
| poisonous energy ball. If you get hit by this you'll take five ticks of     |
| damage and it can be deadly. The simplest way to avoid this is position     |
| yourself around the corner of Phantom when he casts the spell so it hits    |
| the wall. This is also a good time to recast Stopra on the clock, you'll    |
| want to do this about every other time Phantom casts his energy ball to     |
| avoid losing a team member. The battle will loop like this until you beat   |
| Phantom, so use Ethers/Elixirs as you need to keep your MP high enough to   |
| cast spells.                                                                |

|                                                                             |
|  Kurt Zisa breaks down in this phase uses its head to stretch out like a    |
| snake to attack. The attack is weak and shouldn't do much, you can heal     |
| through the damage anyways since magic is no longer sealed. Take this       |
| opportunity to really lay it on Kurt Zisa, seriously go all out and get as  |
| much damage as you can in. If you can take down at least half of his health |
| you're in great shape. Once the head retracts and Kurt Zisa stands up this  |
| phase is over and the third phase begins.                                   |
|                                                                             |
|  Kurt will put up a shield and float around the arena summoning tornadoes   |
| and fireballs. The trick is to deal damage to the shield in the form of     |
| magic. Thunder is good but Blizzard is best if you can get all of the       |
| flakes to the hit the shield, and that requires patience. Hitting the fire  |
| back at Kurt is also effective at knocking the shield down. Physical        |
| attacks will cause clear orbs to drop so you can refill the Charge Gauge,   |
| which is useful. When the shield goes down Kurt Zisa will rever to phase    |
| two and then back to phase one. When phase one starts again Kurt Zisa will  |
| twirl around the battlefield and you'll need to Dodge Roll or Glide past    |
| the attacks, else you face massive damage. By the third time you enter      |
| phase two you should be able to defeat Kurt Zisa.                           |

The Unknown
�����������
  The final boss you'll want to face is listed in the Journal simply as "?" and
given the title of Unknown. Having played the other games in the series you can
deduce who this Nobody is, but it won't be included here. You can face the
Unknown by heading to the Castle Chapel in Hollow Bastion. Step into the dark
portal to start a scene that leads into a battle with this foe.

        | The achievement "He Who Doesn't Exist" lists it as "Defeat  |
        | the Mysterious Man in Hollow Bastion" though the journal    |
        | lists him as Unknown. Playing through Re: Chain of Memories |
        | and watching 358/2 Days should give plenty of insight as to |
        | who this figure truly is.                                   |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HP: 1500                    |  Start off by settings your shortcuts to      |
| Attack: 46                  | Graviga, Aeroga, and Curaga. Believe it or    |
| Defense: 46                 | not, this foe is effected by Graviga. Not in  |
| Weak: N/A                   | the standard way of course, but it will bring |
| Resist: N/A                 | him to his knees allowing you to hack away.   |
| Drop: EXP Necklace          | Start the battle by summoning Tinker Bell and |
| Experience: 12000           | casting Aeroga. Lock on and get ready to      |
|-----------------------------' Dodge Roll some lightning fields. Unknown     |
| will toss around balls of lightning that hit the ground and spread into a   |
| sphere of pain, so keep away. With those avoided, you can start laying      |
| combos into the Mysterious Man. You're going to take damage, but it's easy  |
| heal through with Aeroga up and Tinker Bell might just do the trick. If you |
| had a bunch of items left over you could always stock up Donald and Goofy   |
| with Elixir and Megalixirs so you are in tip-top shape.                     |
|                                                                             |
|  Once you deal 300 points of damage, Unknown will start to teleport around  |
| and after another 300 points he'll begin to summon ethereal blades that he  |
| will toss at Sora. Dodge Roll this attack and start using Strike Raid to    |
| deal damage while becoming invulnerable to the lightning damage. Once the   |
| Unknown is down to 600 health he'll start using a technique that messes     |
| with your commands. Triangle and your top three options will alternate      |
| between Shock and Release very quickly, you need to hit the right one. It   |
| is best to just smash the Cross button and hit up then down in hopes of     |
| landing on Release quickly. The Shock doesn't deal much damage so you want  |
| to just be quick about getting released. During this time you'll want to    |
| start using Graviga before Unknown teleports and you'll bring him to his    |
| knees. This is great for healing or tacking on some additional damage. If   |
| the going gets tough, use Strike Raid and Sonic Blade to avoid all the      |
| damage and use Elixirs to refill your MP. Gravity Break is a great finisher |
| for this fight, so you can add that as well.                                |

  For defeating Unknown you'll acquire an # TODO: [EXP NECKLACE] and [ANSEM'S REPORT 13] #
as a reward for the tough battle. Reading through this report should shed some
light on the Unknown's identity.

Where Can I Find Rare Materials?
��������������������������������
  You can find numerous Dark Matter via chests but you can also Synthesize
them. The same thing applies to Mythril. Mystery Goo is obtained from either a
Rare Truffle or White Mushroom. You can check out how to conquer these Heartless
and win their Mystery Goo in section # TODO: [0508] #. Gale drops from the Invisibles at
the End of the World. The Stones can be found from defeating new enemies to the

How Many Materials Do I Need?

  Not as many as you might think. Equipping Lucky Strike on every character is
a good way to collect a lot of the common items. Below you'll see how many of
each item you'll need to collect in order to make all 33 items.

  So now you know how to defeat these White Mushrooms and get the items they
drop, but what do they drop? Casting the same spell on the White Mushroom raises
the chance of dropping rarer items and does away with the Shards, instead it
replaces them with Arts. These can be sold for Munny, but if you get one of each
Art you can visit Merlin to receive Goofy's # TODO: [DREAM SHIELD] #.

Rare Truffles
�������������
  Similar in appearance to White Mushrooms, though colored blue and yellow,
they also are non-combatant Heartless. Instead of wandering around gesturing
the Rare Truffle will jump into the air constantly. Perhaps its desire is to fly
or maybe it just likes to bounce, either way it loves to be "juggled" in the
air. There are multiple ways to do this, one is let the Rare Truffle get into a
corner and cast Aeroga on Sora when the Rare Truffle jumps. This will let the
Heartless bounce up and down, you just need to recast Aeroga to keep it going.
The other way is to jump up and swing the Keyblade, knocking the Rare Truffle
back into the air. It's about timing this way; Jump, swing, land, pause. Repeat
this pattern to keep the Rare Truffle up.

  You receive n Tech Points per "juggle" where n = the number of times you've
hit the Rare Truffle. You can't hit it more than 100 times so doing the math,
which is (n(n + 1))/2, you will gain a total of 5050 Experience points if you do
100 juggles. It's prudent for attempting maximum experience gain to get to the
higher numbers, because only hitting it 50 times results in only 1275 XP. So,
what's the point of this? To get rare items! Check the charts below for the
prizes and locations of Rare Truffles.

Black Fungi
�����������
  Unlike the others, these Mushrooms will attack by spewing poison out from
around themselves. They also only take 1 HP of damage every hit so you need to
hit them 9 times. The final hit needs to be a critical finisher or else you
won't get any items. They have a 100% chance to drop # TODO: [MYSTERY GOO] # defeated in
this manner and an additional 10% to get a # TODO: [MYSTERY MOLD] # which sells for 3,000

Are you not entertained?
������������������������
  The Olympus Coliseum is a unique world because you will revisit it several
times throughout the course of the game. Once you have defeated Cerberus and
saved the Coliseum some tournaments, referred to as a cup, will begin to open
during the course of the game. Stop by as they are unlocked to participate and
win great prizes.

 Phil Cup - Seal the Traverse Town Keyhole
 Pegasus Cup - Complete Monstro
 Hercules Cup - Seal the Halloween Town and Neverland Keyholes
 Hades Cup - Seal the Hollow Bastion Keyhole
 Gold Match - Complete the Hades Cup
 Platinum Match - Complete all four cups

Different Modes
���������������
  You'll start with Sora, Donald, and Goofy as you attempt to clear all nine
battles. If you complete this mode you'll unlock another, using just Sora.
Complete this mode to unlock a Time Trial.

Conquering the Phil Cup
�����������������������
  The first two groups will go down from a Blizzard blast or two and during a
time trial you'll gain a lot of time by doing that. For the Big Feet battle
you'll want to take out the Powerwild first so you can focus on the Hammerlegs
by themselves. This same concept applies for the Nightwalkers and Hard Hitters
groups. During a Time Trial you can utilize Gravity during the waves with Large
Bodies to increase your time through them. The Shadow Battalion group is where
you'll want to use all of your magic, like Fire, to tear through the little
guys and then focus on the Armored Torso.

| Defense: 46                 | bad idea, since using Aeroga will force Ice   |

| Experience: 5000            | have a bad time. This giant can only be hit   |
|-----------------------------' during battle when his attacks are reflected  |
| back at him. Move to a corner of the arena and wait for the icicles to      |
| start flying at you, then simply guard against them. Unfortunately, this    |
| isn't the only attack the Ice Titan has in his arsenal. It also summons     |
| three large boulders to fall just above your head and it uses an icy breath |
| across half the arena. This all seems pretty vicious and it can be if you   |
| don't Dodge Roll away or Glide. Between these attacks you'll have icicles   |
| flying towards you, remember to just block them and eventually the Ice      |
| Titan will become exhausted and keel over. Use this opportunity to get some |
| attacks in before it stands back up. Once it does stand up, the Ice Titan   |
| emits a frosty ring around itself then follows up with a large flurry of    |
| icicles and then ice boulders. Reflect the icicles then start Dodge Rolling |
| out of the way and the normal pattern will resume.                          |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HP: 1800                   |  Sephiroth is completely immune to magical     |
| Attack: 42                 | damage, so make your magic shortcuts Aeroga    |
| Defense: 34                | and Curaga. It is also highly recommended to   |

| Drop: Ansem's Report 12    | all equipped. Remove any other attack ability  |
| Experience: 10000          | and have at maximum one additional Combo Plus  |
|----------------------------' so you can finish your combos. Berserk and     |
| Critical Plus are great to equip, and for equipment anything with Dark      |
| Resistance will help but don't sacrifice Defense for Dark Resistance. Use   |
| Ultima Weapon Keyblade or Divine Rose, whichever you have. Lastly, put an   |
| Elixir in every item slot.                                                  |
|                                                                             |
|  The battle itself is in three stages and changes when Sephiroth loses 600  |
| health. The initial phase has Sephiroth using slashes and an ability called |
| Stigma, where he summons pillars of fire around himself. You can time your  |
| strikes on Sephiroth by leaping and swinging when he rushes at you, but it  |
| might be better to just use Aeroga and constantly Guard if you aren't good  |
| with the timing of your strike. When you do get a combo in you'll want to   |
| reach the Combo Finish or else he will teleport and slash you, to which you |
| should Dodge Roll. After you deal 300 points of damage you'll start to see  |
| Sephiroth taking damage to which he will begin a attacking a little faster  |
| instead of just walking around. If you are having trouble, use Strike Raid  |
| repeatedly to quickly burn through Sephiroth's health and remain immune.    |
|                                                                             |
|  After taking away his first two health bars, Sephiroth will integrate a    |
| new attack into his pattern, Heartless Angel. You'll know you've entered    |
| this phase because it's his first attack and he even calls out the attack,  |
| "Descend, Heartless Angel" after he teleports to the other end of the arena |
| where you'll need to hit him quickly. If you fail to hit Sephiroth either   |
| by using Strike Raid or Supergliding over to him, you'll be reduced to 1 HP |
| and 0 MP. This is usually followed by a teleport slash and you're dead, so  |
| break this up! During this phase it's best to just stay in the center of    |
| arena and wait for Heartless Angel since it's easy to get a good combo off  |
| on Sephiroth. If you have trouble with this, work on timing an Elixir as    |
| soon as you get hit with Heartless Angel and you'll back in the fight. In   |
| addition, Sephiroth uses Omnislash too. With Leaf Bracer equipped you can   |
| just cast Curaga to heal as he hits you if you can't dodge. Like the first  |
| phase, Strike Raid or Sonic Blade work well but also use a lot of MP.       |
|                                                                             |
|  After another 600 points of damage, Sephiroth will be at his yellow health |
| bar and start his third phase by casting Supernova. It is possible to dodge |
| the meteors and the final hit which can be lethal, but it is once again     |
| best to use Strike Raid just before the hit so you are invincible and then  |
| immediately start damage on Sephiroth once he is no longer invincible. He   |
| also starts using Shadow Flare, conjuring orbs of darkness around himself   |
| that hurt and break up your combos. All of these attacks are in addition to |
| those he gained in phase two, so you need to still look out for Heartless   |
| Angel. You can wait for this attack to deal damage and then use Strike Raid |
| or Sonic Blade to hit during other attacks to negate damage to yourself and |
| get in easy damage on Sephiroth. Don't shy away from using Elixirs to heal  |
| and regen your HP, this is a tough battle that should merit the use of such |
| rare items.                                                                 |

How to:
�������
  You can start his mini-game by disembarking at Jungle: Tunnel. From here just
jump inside the log to begin the mini-game. Your objective is to collect fruit
and there are 10 pieces per stage. Each stage connects to the next one so you'll
end up going through the first few stages often since you have to restart to
unlock the next stage.

Stage 1
�������
  The first three fruit are on the left, the next three are on the right, then
three more are right down the center. When you reach the branches jump over the
first then swing to smash the second. Jump over the third and in the middle of
your landing area is the 10th fruit. You receive an # TODO: [ELIXIR] # for getting all 10
and if you are going to Stage 2 go left.

Stage 2
�������
  In this cave you'll find the first six fruits in the middle, two groups of
three. The next three are in a larger open area but still relatively centered.
After grabbing these three take a sharp right to reach the 20th fruit and
receive an # TODO: [AP UP] # for your efforts. If you're headed to Stage 3 take the left
path at the split.

Stage 3
�������
  The first three fruits are dead center. Hug the left edge around the curve to
get the second group of three then return to center for the next group of three.
The final fruit is just ahead dead center. For getting 30 fruit you'll receive
a # TODO: [DARK MATTER] #. Stay right at the split to reach Stage 4.

Stage 4
�������
  There are four fruits right in the center of the track. Ignore the branch that
hides the last one, it doesn't hurt you. Stick to the right around the curves to
grab two more fruit then cut back left quickly to grab the remaining four. You
receive a # TODO: [DEFENSE UP] # for picking up the first 40 fruit. Go left at the split
to reach Stage 5.

Stage 5
�������
  All the fruit is in the center. It might be a bit deceiving with all the
water but for the most part, it's all right in front you. Collect them all to
reach 50 total and receive a # TODO: [POWER UP] #.

Fire Element
������������
  A fireball that automatically homes in on remote targets but does not execute
sharp turn. Can only hit one target.

Damage: Fire = MP+20
        Fira = MP+24
        Firaga = MP+30

Upgrades: Traverse Town
          Agrabah
          Hollow Bastion

Blizzard Element
����������������
  Short-range attack that flings seven ice crystals, covering a conical area.
Increase power widens the cone. Opponents who are hit by several crystal do not
take accumulated damage. Attack can be parried with a shield.

Damage: Blizzard = (MP+22) * # of flakes
        Blizzara = (MP+26) * # of flakes
        Blizzaga = (MP+32) * # of flakes

Upgrades: Wonderland
          Agrabah
          Olympus Coliseum

Thunder Element
���������������
  Creates flashes of lightning around Sora or the locked-on target. Increased
power improves the range. This spell can damage several targets.

������������
  Restores a character's HP. Best used at a distance from the battle action, as
it has a short preparatory stage.

      Curaga = (MP * 3)+30

Upgrades: Deep Jungle
          Neverland
          Hollow Bastion

Gravity Element
���������������
  Creates a dark sphere. Targets within its radius take a % of their Max HP
(damage). Most boss monsters are immune to Gravity attacks. If Sora has 12 HP
when using Gravity, 9 with Gravira, or 6 with Graviga, the enemy will be reduced
to 0 HP.

Stop Element
������������
  The target is stopped for the duration. The effect unfolds around Sora or the

Upgrades: Monstro
          Hundred Acre Wood
          Neverland

Wind Element
������������
  A barrier that reduces damage taken by enemy attacks by half is created around

  This section contains a list of all Heartless not including bosses. The table
includes HP (Health Points), ATK (Attack), DEF (Defense), MPR (Magic Point
Recovery Speed), and EXP (Experience). PHB (Pre-Hollow Bastion) and AHB (After
Hollow Bastion) values are based on before the rescue of Kairi and defeat of
Riku-Ansem and afterwards. The right side of the table details damage dealt
according to element, x1.0 being normal damage and numbers greater dealing more
than normal, numbers less than x1.0 dealing partial damage. The Worlds are
initialized as follows:

     TT = Traverse Town
     WL = Wonderland
     OC = Olympus Coliseum
     DJ = Deep Jungle
     AG = Agrabah
     MO = Monstro
     AT = Atlantica
     HT = Halloween Town
     HB = Hollow Bastion
     EW = End of the World
